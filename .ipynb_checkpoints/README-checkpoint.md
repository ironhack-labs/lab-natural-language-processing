# Lab | Natural Language Processing

## Introduction

### Introduction

In this lab, you will explore various techniques and tools used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). By working through this guided notebook, you will gain hands-on experience with text preprocessing, tokenization, and implementing NLP models to analyze and understand human language data. This lab will help you understand the core concepts and practical applications of NLP in real-world scenarios.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. There are a bunch of questions to be solved. If you get stuck in one exercise you can skip to the next one. Read each instruction carefully and provide your answer beneath it.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
