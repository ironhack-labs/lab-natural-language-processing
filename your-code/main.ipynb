In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A d=ollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one= of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on (July 21,= 2003) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have =been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we =cannot =B5 release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or rela=tive on to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines,But unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation d=ied alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the cla=im. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my depar=tment now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the mo=ney to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and su=bsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don=92t want thi=s money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained u=nclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasu=ry as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this busin=ess is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner,and a Burki=nabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this= money will be for you as foreign partner,in respect to the provision of a =foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the bus=iness and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague.

Mr. Hope Sithole one of the Personal Assistants to the young President Joseph Kabila of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), since he assumed power.Sincerely speaking, my agitation is real, and my word is my bond in this proposal. This money in question is part of the budget made by our President Mr. Joseph Kabila, in the fear that members of the United Nations (UN) could perhaps be mandated to offer their respective supports in forcing Iraq to disarm themselves. Eventually, his dreams do not match up with realities and as a result he (the President) started using the money on personal ground because nobody could question/probe his actions, as he believed.</STRONG></DIV><DIV><STRONG>As his closest personal assistant and with the help of two other officials one of whom was the then deputy Director, Safety and Security Department, we were able to escape with two boxes containing the aforementioned sum. At present the boxes were deposited in a reputable Security firm here in South Africa and were registered as family belongings. We had agreed on the need for a foreign assistance with a legitimate bank account abroad, that will stand as, the beneficiary and partner as well in order to avoid suspicion, since we are existing as refugees here. Copies of certificate of Deposit as well as all necessary documents from the Security cc. are available for a hitch-free transaction.</STRONG></DIV><DIV><STRONG>In addition, you are also required to come/send a representative (as far as you trust the person representing) to the Republic of South Africa for the purpose of the transfer, but only if, by one reason or the other you cannot embark on a Five working (5) days trip by yourself, according to the expert from within the bank. As things are now we had not really agreed on the actual amount that should be your remuneration for your kind assistance, which to us is no big deal. The crux of this subject in particular is the declaration of your interest after-which we enter into negotiations with you over the (percentage) issue. Other details of which you may want to know shall be discussed in due course.</STRONG></DIV><DIV><BR><STRONG>Please be kind enough to acknowledge this proposal by responding through the above E-mail address for a high level of confidentiality in this business deal.</STRONG></DIV><DIV><STRONG>Best regards,</STRONG></DIV><DIV><BR><STRONG>Hon.

         ">From Monica YanganiEmail monicayangani250@netscape.netTel 27 8046828612ATTN:Sir/Madam ÃÂ  I know you will be surprised to hear from me, but please consider this as a request from family in dire need of assistance.I am Mrs.Monica Yangani, writing to you from Government Reserved Area (GRA).I got your contact information from the Republic of Congo Chamber of Commerce and Industry. When I was searching for a reliable individual or private company that can assist me to transfer a reasonable amount in a safe account abroad on behalf of my late husband, two sons and two daughters. I decided to solicit your assistance to transfer this sum of US $20 Million (Twenty Million, United States Dollars)inherited from my late husband in to your personal companyÃ¢ÂÂs account or private account.Before his death, he was a Brigadier in charge of arms and ammunition procurement for the (DRC) army. In his WILL?he specifically draws my attention to this US$ 20 Million which he deposited in a safe box in Private Security Company in South Africa. ÃÂ During the war, he was very dedicated and committed to winning the war against the rebels until when he found out that some Senior Army Officers and Government Functionaries were busy helping themselves with government funds and properties and sending them toforeign countries. Due to this, he and his former special advisers to the president were assigned by the President (Laurent Kabila) to purchase arms in South Africa, they saw this as a golden opportunity and diverted the money and divided it and he got a total sum of US $20 Million. He deposited the box in my sonÃ¢ÂÂs name and him alone with the deposit code canclaim it.I will be grateful if you can assist us now. I want you to do for us as an international partner to help us transfer this money which is in a safety box in the Security Company using your name as the beneficiary ofthis sum. You can contact ÃÂ me or my son (George Yangani) ÃÂ inSouth Africa on ÃÂ this number+27 8046828612. Then, we will tell you more details about it. We are in position to inform you of the whole procedures mapped out of the transfer of this money.We have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum for your assistance, 5% for any expenses that might occur from both sides in the course of this transaction,while the remaining 70% will be for my son's investment, which you will assist him to do abroad.Further information and arrangement will commence as soon as trust, confidence and good relationship will be established and safety of this fund assured when transferred to your account.Please treat this matter with utmost urgency.May Allah (God) bless you as I earnestly hope for yourassistance.

I DEPOSITED THE BOX CONTAINING THIS MONEY IN A SECURITYCOMPANY IN JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH  AFRICA. DURING THE WAR, I WAS VERY DEDICATEDAND OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES WERE BUSSY  HELPING THEMSELVES WITHGOVERNMENT FUNDS AND  PROPERTIES AND SENDING THEM TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  DUETO THIS, WHEN I AND MY FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE  PRESIDENT WERE ASSIGNEDBY THE PRESIDENT (EDUARDO  SANTOS) TO PURCHASE ARMS IN SOUTH AFRICA, WE SAW  THISAS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY AND DIVERTED THE MONEY AND  DIVIDED IT. i GOT A TOTAL SUMOF US$21.5 MILLION.

Prior to their death, this white couple had lived in this country since the 1960?s as missionaries and educationists. Unfortunately, they died childless, with no knownrelatives or next of kin.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>The issue at stake, for which I am writing you now, is that the deceased left behind the sum of US$7.8million in their joint account with ECO INTERNATIONAL BANK Nigeria Incorporated.<BR>Soon after the burial of the deceased, I had promptly notified the bank,which is awaiting me to present to them the person that is to inherit the account of the deceased.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Incidentally, as I said before, the late couple had no known next of kin or relatives. No one else knows about this.However, it will amount to abuse of privilege for me to lay claim to the wealth and estate of the deceased, since as a black man i couldn't have been their relative. But then funds can't be left to the bank permanently/forever. So I have decided to contact you, to seek your consent to present your name to the bank as the next of kin and the appointed administrator/inheritor of the estates of the deceased.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;As a whiteman, you'll fit into the picture.As the lawyer to the deceased, no body can disbelieve me if i present you as the next of kin to the deceased. Moreover, I know the exact legal requirements and documents to secure in your favour to show proof that you are actually the next of kin/inheritor of everything left behind by the deceased. All these will be my responsibility to obtain from the court here in Nigeria. You won?t be needed here in person.</DIV><DIV>I can assure you that this is my specialty and there is nothing for you to be afraid of. I will handle and provide for all that it will take legally.Once everything needful is done, the bank will be satisfied to transfer the monies from the account of the deceased to yours.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>My interest is to take 60% of the funds while you take 30%, while the remaining 10% will be disbursed to any Orphanage-Home of our common choice.Please communicate your decision to me urgently, indicating your Telephone number in your reply so that I can call you and talk this thing over with you.</DIV><DIV>Pls. keep these disclosures confidential.<BR>Thank you.<BR></DIV><DIV>Sincerely yours,<BR>Barrister PATRICK AGOLO(ESQ)</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV><p>\t\t<hr size=1>Do you Yahoo!?<br> Read only the mail you want - <a href=\"http://us.rd.yahoo.com/mail_us/taglines/spamguard/*http://promotions.yahoo.comew_mail/static/protection.html\">Yahoo!

I was furnished with viable information from the Intern=ational Trade Centre here in Johannesburg and I decided to write to yo=u. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to d=eposit the sum of USD$15,000,000(FIFTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS=),in a Security Company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in &nb=sp;Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and the esta=blishment of the new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when Zimbabwean President MR.ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new Land Act whic=h wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers. T=his resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans =and some lunatics in the society. Infact, alot of people have been= killed because of this land reformed Act for which my father was one =of the victims. It is against this background, that I and my family= who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my fath=er's money to foreign account since the law of South Africa prohibits =a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved i=n any financial transaction. As the eldest son of my father, I am =saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account w=here this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everyth=ing we have got. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount =of money in South Africa for fear of going through the same experie=nce in future since both countries have similar political history. Mor=eover,the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such in=vestment as an asylum seeker. As a businessman, whom I have entrusted =my future and of my family in his hands,I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family,=all I need you to do for me is to make arrangement and come to Johanne=sburg -South Africa so that you can open a non-resident account which =will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nomina=te overseas. This money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you,firstly you can choose to have a certain percentage o=f the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for t=he proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Which ev=er the option you want,feel free to notify me as I have also mapped ou=t5% of this money for all kinds of expences incurred in the proccess o=f this transaction.If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to =give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will be for my in=vestment in your country.

         "Greetings!!!I am Mr Martins Imaa Lucas, a member of staff in a Corporate Securities firm. We keep valuables for high net worth individuals, blue chip corporations and diplomatic organisations.I am contacting you in regards to our client, the late Chief (Mrs.) Stella Obasanjo, who died on Sunday October 23, 2005 in a surgical operation in Spain. This client has a total deposit of Thirty Two Million United States Dollars in our vaults. After the 9/11 incidents, our company policy do not permit cash deposit, so he confided in me as the foreign operations officer to make this deposit since June 2004. She did this to avoid traces f the money to her since her husband, president Olusegun Obansanjo was against any corruption and embezzlement of funds.The last communication I had with her was on the 25th of August 2005, where she was making arrangements to claim the deposit. Thereafter it was revealed that she died of a surgical operation in Spain in October. After the acknowledgement of her death, it became apparent that there was no claim to her funds since she listed no next of kin in her bio-data form. She made the deposit under the name of Guardian Trust investment (GTI) and disclosed the content as company valuables and Antiques. This was for confidentiality and to reduce taxes.If no claim is made within six months, the company under its storage terms and conditions will legally auction the content of the deposit. If discovered that the content is cash, it will be confiscated and I would be penalised, since I accepted the cash deposit against the companyÃ¯Â¿Â½s regulations. As a staff, it is impossible for me to have access to the funds or claim it myself. More so, such valuable deposits are kept at a different branch, where we have our terminal facilities. Consequently, it is important that I find a credible candidate to play the role of the Trustee or representative of Guardian Trust investment to help claim the deposit. It is on this ground that I need your assistance to claim the funds which will be possible with the information I hold. Once this is achieved, you shall be entitled to 50% of the total funds while I shall retain the balance 50%.I am aware of the risks involved in this proposal, therefore I ask that you consider the factors above and keep it strictly confidential. However, if you feel you are unable tofulfil this role, I request you discard of this letter.I look forward to hearing form you.Thank you.Mr Martins Imaa Lucas",

After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned =and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand =of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. =On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser=92s family wife and =two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, =including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under =dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the owner since 2003.

         "this is it pretty uncompelling piece if you ask me but of course biased mitt romney new course for the middle eastrestore the three sinews of american influence our economic strength our military strength and the strength of our values disturbing developments are sweeping across the greater middle east in syria tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered in egypt the muslimbrotherhood has come to power and the country peace treaty with israel hangs in the balance in libya our ambassador was murdered in terrorist attack embassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests and in iran the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear weapons capability allthe while promising to annihilate israel these developments are not as president obama says mere bumps in the road they are major issues that put our security at risk yet amid this upheaval our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them we re not moving them in direction that protects our people orour allies and that dangerous if the middle east descends into chaos if iran moves toward nuclear breakout or if israel security is compromised america could bepulled into the maelstrom we still have time to address these threats but it will require new strategy toward the middle eastthe first step is to understand how we got here since world war ii america has been the leader of the free world we re unique in having earned that role notthrough conquest but through promoting human rights free markets and the rule of law we ally ourselves with like minded countries expand prosperity throughtrade and keep the peace by maintaining military second to none but in recent years president obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy our economy is stuck in recovery that barely deserves the name our nationaldebt has risen to record levels our military tested by decade of war is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the white house finally our values have been misapplied and misunderstood by president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries by failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies president obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability he does not understand that an american policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder the middle east is case in point the arab spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom but it also presentedgrave risks we needed strategy for success but the president offered none and now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past fewweeksthe same incomprehension afflicts the president policy toward israel the president began his term with the explicit policy of creating daylight between our twocountries he recently downgraded israel from being our closest ally in the middle east to being only one of our closest allies it diplomatic message that willbe received clearly by israel and its adversaries alike he dismissed israel concerns about iran as mere noise that he prefers to block out and at time whenisrael needs america to stand with it he declined to meet with prime minister benjamin netanyahu in this period of uncertainty we need to apply coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the middle east that is both governments and individuals whoshare our values this means restoring our credibility with iran when we say an iranian nuclear weapons capability and the regional instability that comes with it is unacceptablethe ayatollahs must be made to believe us it means placing no daylight between the united states and israel and it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity forthose who have for too long known only corruption and oppression the dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives toextremism but this middle east policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence our economic strength our military strength and the strength ofour values that will require very different set of policies from those president obama is pursuing department of statecase no doc no date state dept produced to house select benghazi comm subject to agreement on

         "Good day You may be surprise to receive this letter from mesince you don't know me personally. I am Mr.Jonathan Bongani the son of Dr. Simon Bongani,who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through the South Africa Informations Exchange (S.A.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you, my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority.   Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg -South Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 35.5 Million (Thirty-five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was depositedin a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the \"modus operandi\" adopted by the government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs.  precisely, More than thirty-one (31) people have so far been killed.Heads of governments from the west, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe's plan. Subsequently, South African Development Community(S.A.D.C) has continously supported Mugabe's new land act, it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father's money into a foreign account.   As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa's government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history.More so, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an \"ASYLUM\".   As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.For your assistance,we are offering you 30% of the total sum,60% for me and my family while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we may incure during the course of this transaction.We wish to invest ourpart of the money on commercial property based on your advice. Finally,all we demand from you is assurance that you will not sit on this money when it finally gets to your personal or company's account in your country.  If this proposal is acceptable by you, please confirm your interest via the above TELEPHONE number +27-83-424-7661or E-MAIL to the above address. Best Regards. Jonathan Bongani(For the Family)."

A. E. I write=20you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with=20the information I am about to reveal to you.I have an urgent and very=20confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an=20Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM=20CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36=20calendar months, valued at  US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five=20hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his=20account officer before I was moved to my present position recently.=20Upon maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as well the bank=20manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a=20routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was=20returned undelivered.=20After sometime, I tried sending back the=20letter, but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his=20contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al=20Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein=20(former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq,=20as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further=20investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser=E2=80=99s family wife and tw=o=20sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not=20declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents,=20including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any=20WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under=20dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have=20heard from the owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the=20investigation I have made so far, my bank management is not aware of=20it, I am the only one that have the information.With the recent change=20of government in my country and with their efforts to support the=20United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of=20this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which=20will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of=20above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it=20is not for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the=20country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely=20confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner=20to explain the source of the money. I cannot directly transfer out this=20money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting=20you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser,=20coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of=20Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of the=20funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account,=20with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give=20you. All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully=20worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction=20will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you=20from any breach of law, beside U.

         "This is it. Pretty uncompelling piece if you ask me but of course I'm biased.Mitt Romney: A New Course for the Middle EastRestore the three sinews of American influence: our economic strength our military strength and the strength of our values.Disturbing developments are sweeping across the greater Middle East. In Syria tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered. In Egypt the MuslimBrotherhood has come to power and the country's peace treaty with Israel hangs In the balance. In Libya our ambassador was murdered In a terrorist attack. U.S.embassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests. And in Iran the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability allthe while promising to annihilate Israel.These developments are not as President Obama says mere \"bumps in the road.\" They are major issues that put our security at risk.Yet amid this upheaval our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them. We're not moving them in a direction that protects our people orour allies.And that's dangerous. If the Middle East descends into chaos if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout or if Israel's security is compromised America could bepulled into the maelstrom.We still have time to address these threats but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle EastThe first step is to understand how we got here. Since World War II America has been the leader of the Free World. We're unique in having earned that role notthrough conquest but through promoting human rights free markets and the rule of law. We ally ourselves with like-minded countries expand prosperity throughtrade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none.But in recent years President Obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy. Our economy is stuck in a \"recovery\" that barely deserves the name. Our nationaldebt has risen to record levels. Our military tested by a decade of war is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White House.Finally our values have been misappliedÃ¢ÂÂand misunderstoodÃ¢ÂÂby a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries.By failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies President Obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability.He does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder.The Middle East is a case in point. The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom. But it also presentedgrave risks. We needed a strategy for success but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past fewweeksThe same incomprehension afflicts the president's policy toward Israel. The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating \"daylight\" between our twocountries. He recently downgraded Israel from being our \"closest ally\" in the Middle East to being only \"one of our closest allies.\" It's a diplomatic message that willbe received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel's concerns about Iran as mere \"noise\" that he prefers to \"block out.\" And at a time whenIsrael needs America to stand with it he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.In this period of uncertainty we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle EastÃ¢ÂÂthat is both governments and individuals whoshare our values.This means restoring our credibility with Iran. When we say an Iranian nuclear-weapons capabilityÃ¢ÂÂand the regional instability that comes with it--is unacceptablethe ayatollahs must be made to believe us.It means placing no daylight between the United States and Israel And it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity forthose who have for too long known only corruption and oppression. The dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives toextremism.But this Middle East policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence: our economic strength our military strength and the strength Ofour values. That will require a very different set of policies from those President Obama is pursuing.U.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739629Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

To defend ourselves and our allies we paid the price in treasure and in soldiers who never came home.Our challenges are different now but if the 21st century is to be another American Century we need leaders who understand that keeping the peace requiresAmerican strength in all of its dimensions.Mr. Romney is the Republican Pady candidate for presidentA version of this article appeared October 12012 on page .A.15 in the U.S. edition of The WallStreet Journal with the headline: ANew course for the Middle East."

This is whereI need to employ your assistance and service.WHAT I NEED YOU FOR?At this point, I will be glad if you could work with me as myrepresentative in the US. You will be working as my payment assistantincharge of collecting and processing the payments from my Associates.Since they will be making the payment in Money orders/ Cashier checksmade payable only in the US, you will be collecting this payments andcashing them on my behalf.

         "<DIV><DIV>Hello my dear</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>I wish to solicit your kind and urgent assistance.My name is Mr.PATRICK AGOLO, a lawyer based in Lagos State of Nigeria.As a lawyer, I was a private legal adviser (for almost two decades) to a white couple who unfortunately lost their lives 3-months ago in a ghastly motor accident here in Nigeria. Prior to their death, this white couple had lived in this country since the 1960?s as missionaries and educationists. Unfortunately, they died childless, with no knownrelatives or next of kin.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>The issue at stake, for which I am writing you now, is that the deceased left behind the sum of US$7.8million in their joint account with ECO INTERNATIONAL BANK Nigeria Incorporated.<BR>Soon after the burial of the deceased, I had promptly notified the bank,which is awaiting me to present to them the person that is to inherit the account of the deceased.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Incidentally, as I said before, the late couple had no known next of kin or relatives. No one else knows about this.However, it will amount to abuse of privilege for me to lay claim to the wealth and estate of the deceased, since as a black man i couldn't have been their relative. But then funds can't be left to the bank permanently/forever. So I have decided to contact you, to seek your consent to present your name to the bank as the next of kin and the appointed administrator/inheritor of the estates of the deceased.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;As a whiteman, you'll fit into the picture.As the lawyer to the deceased, no body can disbelieve me if i present you as the next of kin to the deceased. Moreover, I know the exact legal requirements and documents to secure in your favour to show proof that you are actually the next of kin/inheritor of everything left behind by the deceased. All these will be my responsibility to obtain from the court here in Nigeria. You won?t be needed here in person.</DIV><DIV>I can assure you that this is my specialty and there is nothing for you to be afraid of. I will handle and provide for all that it will take legally.Once everything needful is done, the bank will be satisfied to transfer the monies from the account of the deceased to yours.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>My interest is to take 60% of the funds while you take 30%, while the remaining 10% will be disbursed to any Orphanage-Home of our common choice.Please communicate your decision to me urgently, indicating your Telephone number in your reply so that I can call you and talk this thing over with you.</DIV><DIV>Pls. keep these disclosures confidential.<BR>Thank you.<BR></DIV><DIV>Sincerely yours,<BR>Barrister PATRICK AGOLO(ESQ)</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV><p>\t\t<hr size=1>Do you Yahoo!?<br> Read only the mail you want - <a href=\"http://us.rd.yahoo.com/mail_us/taglines/spamguard/*http://promotions.yahoo.comew_mail/static/protection.html\">Yahoo!

         "Dear sir,  It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's properties is under the authority of the family's lawyer Tony Musa.  My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband's wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the \"Personal will\" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f!urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this \"SOS\" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. "

         "Gentlemen for your information below.WernerGFCTo whom it may concern from experience speaking!RSO NiallPlease be aware and as you have requested my elaboration in written format. As brieflydiscussed in the meeting today the LGF operate at what I would consider the \"Threshold'Sleep Deprivation. Further meaning that our work schedule hours and sleeping pattern'the LGF very close to the edge of serious sleep deprivation. When we have to work go.time or ramp up extra manpower (during scheduled off days) due to increased threw .etc...etc...; we further compound the issue of sleep deprivation. This ultimately dirninit:LGF's ability to provide security.To better explain here is where it starts the LGF work 3 days then transition (swing shift) into .nights then transition into 3 days off (it used to be 2x2x2). Each work day equals 14 actin I I!(-)of work; Supervisor's can average up to 15 hours per work day.Snap shot of an average day for a shift:1. 05:00hrs every day Shift Brief for on-going shift along with \"In-Service Training\". .IConvoy Brief followed by convoy load time and organization for entire shift (approx iduring the day) followed by actual convoy movement.2. 05:45 to 06:15hrs. (approximately) you have the shift change over on site3. 06:15 to 17:45 regular work day on site.4. 17:45 to 18:15 Shift change over followed by reorganization of convoy for off-going. sliithen actual convoy movement5. 18:30 (approximately) Off-going shift returns to Camp Sullivan weapons and equipment aredown loaded and convoy equipment is stowed vehicle's re-staged in parking lot.6. 19:00 (approximately) Off-going shift is complete all equipment is accounted for andsecured they are then on personnel time whether to work out and train eat dinner watchmovie internet phone calls sleep or etc.7. 10 hours later it starts all over with a 05:00hrs Shift Brief not taking into considers titwake-up and grooming and breakfast.This averages an actual 14 hour day for each LGF member. Some days can be as short ahours and some days as long as 14.5 hours. Supervisor's can average an additional(approximate) 30 minutes prior to and after a shift conducting administrative duties and or ;1organization. All personal hygiene laundry personal e-mail/matters Physical fitness usuallymeals and sleep must be conducted within the 10 hour window between an individual's shifts.After completing the 3 days in a work cycle which ends at 19:00hrs the shifts swings intonight shift schedule. Their next duty starts at 17:00hrs the following day for the eveningbriefmg. This is a 22 hour transition window which most LGF only sleep once and areagain with the same 14 hour schedule for their first night shift. This can be viewed as gea ione good sleep in for a 36 hours window of time (by the end of their first night shift foltwo more night shifts).When finishing their last night shift they are immediately off however do to working ah(arriving back at Camp Sullivan around 06:30) they sleep most of the first day off. They thehave to adjust back into a night-time sleeping pattern. The second day off is a designatedtraining day. Third day is a scheduled off day.If you average this work schedule out over the course of a month an LGF member transitio'from a day to night sleeping pattern on average of 7 times. It's nearly impossible to establishrhythmic sleeping pattern. This is what causes the sleep deprivation. You can see its efftiekover the course of time.

         "FROM:MRS.MABEL NDLOVUATTN:You may be surprised to receive this letter from mesince you don't know me personally,but for theintroduction,I am MRS. MABEL NDLOVU,the wife ofLate DR.ONOMUA ANDREW NDLOVU who was recentlymurdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe.I got your contact from the INTERNATIONAL TRADECENTRE here in Johhanesburg and decided to writeyou.My Husband was among the few black Zimbabwe richfamers murdered in the cold blood by the agents ofthe ruling governmentof President Robert MUGABE for hisalleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabweanopposition party,controlled by the white minority.Before his death,he had taken me to to deposite thesum of Five Million Dollars US$ 5M.with a securityand finance company as if he knew the looming danger inZimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box asgemstones to avoid much demurrage from the securitycompany. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new farmmachinery and chemicals for the establishment of our new farm inlesotho and Swaziland.This land problem arose when presidentRobert MUGABE introduced a new land act,which wholly affectedthe rich white famers and some blacks vehemently condemned themodusoperand\"adopted by the government. Thisresulted to rampant killings and mob actions by the warveterans and some political thugs presently,morethan SIX-HUNDRED[600]people have so far been killed.Heads ofgovernment from the west,especially The Great Britain and TheUnited states of America have voice their condemnation ofMUGABE'S plan.The South Africa development community (SADEC)hascontinuously supported MUGABE'S new land reformAct.It is against this background that I and my Children who arecurrently staying as REFUGEE in a SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC butcurrently seeking An ASSYLUM in any of THE THE WEST AFRICANCOUNTRIES have decided to transfer my late Husband's money intoa foreignaccount. As the only and LEGITIMATE -WIFE of my latehusband I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking agenuine foreign account where this money could betransfer without theknowledge of my country'sgovernment who are tatically freezing ourfamilieswealthback home in ZIMBABWE and The SouthAfrica government seems to be playing along withthem. I am faced with the delimma of investing this amount ofmoney in The South Africa Republic for the fear of encounteringthe same experience in future since both countries have almostthe same political history.Moreso ,the South Africa Financialforeign exchange policy does not allow such investment henceI am seeking for Assistance.As a business person whomI must entrust my future and that of my family on hishands,I must let you know that this transfer is 100%RISK FREE . Therefore if you accept to assist my family,we arewilling to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assitance,70%for me and my family,while 10% will be mapped out for allexpenses.I would wish to invest in your country on REAL- ESTATEbased on your advice and I would also receive assurance that youwould'nt sit on this money when transfered into your personalor company account. If this PLEA is acceptable by you please dosend me your personaldetails,Name and Address,telephone and fax numbers .You should know that this business is highly confidential and shallbe kept within you alone.I hope to hear from you soonon the  email address bellow.(mabel45@ureach.com)Thanks,Best Regards,MRS MABEL NDLOVU. ___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent from WebMail service at - http://yoursitenamehere.com"

         "Greeting,Sir,I am contacting you believing you are a honest and trustworthy person.I =believe you will not betray the confidence I am willing to repose in you, for =me to have contacted you even though we've not met before.My name is Martin Goudal=E9,the only son of late Mr.Hassan Goudal=E9, who was =the chairman /President/CEO,Cacao-Cafe & Agro-Alimentary industries =plc.SCAFECAO)\"Bouake\" and ex-owner of Polyclinic LA-MADONNE, of the Republic =of Cote d'Ivoire.You can find the story on thiswebsite:http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2269238.stmOn 19th of September 2002,a group of so called rebels took over the city of =Bouake to over-throw the Government of Mr.Laurent Gbagbo the President of =Cote d'Ivoire. On the 20th day morning at about 4:18am some fractions of the =same group of rebels break into our house and killed our security guard and =pass-through the gate entrance to the main building and took my father away =to an un-known destination.After about four hours later we found him (my father) at the road side, by =then he had been totally beaten and was bleeding to death lying in the pool =of his own blood. From there, we rushed him to a near by hospital and hours =later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can not make it from the =doctors diagnosis, he also told her that it was because he (my father) was =not from the northern part of the country that he has been treated this way =and also being a political activist. And again he said he is suspecting some =of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also =told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million =dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only)in a Finance House =and also told her where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit =that is made for investment purpose in the western world.That same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost. Then with the help of the =French soldiers, we escaped to Senegal, where we are now. I am now contacting =you believing you are honest and trustworthy to help us to receive the money =in your account for investment, I and my mother has decided in compensating =you 20%of the total amount for your assistance .Please do take your time to go through the mail and get back to us, so that I =will simply introduce to the Finance House where the fund are being kept now =for onward transfer.I am waiting for your response.Thanks and God bless.Martin Goudal=E9.martin9aa@hotmail.com  --49fe152f-ba47-4e97-a233-4b208418672b--"

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed bills.</P><P>The Banking law and guide line here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Six and half years, the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and an indigene cannot stand as next of kin to the deceased family. We agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect of your assistance in this business, and 70 % would be for me and two of my staff in the business.</P><P>Thereafter,I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore, to enhance the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged,you must apply first to the Bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your private, telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.

I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial for both of us at the end of it.During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on October 31st 2002 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relatives before our discovery to this development.The said amount was U.S $22.2M (twenty two million two hundred thousand United States dollars).As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through the Burkina-faso chamber of foreign relations here in Ouagadougou Burkina-faso.Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(As a Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 60% will be for me . Please, you have been adviced to keep \"TOP-SECRET\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal .I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and  further  investment, either in your country or any country you advice me  to invest in.All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you.if you are really sure of your integrity reply me immediately or you call me on my mobile phone .Yours faithfully,Dr Ibrahim Bello.00226-76-441-987._________________________________________________________________Don't just search.

I am an old woman; suffering from cancer. From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live long, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very severe stage. My late husband died in an air crash on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline Boeing 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this fact from the website which was aired by the BBC WORLD NEWS:(http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm) and my only daughter died in LONDON ATTACK BOMB. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for so long and I am so scared about this. So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the well being of less privileged people and handicapped in the society of world America, Canada, Africa, Europe and Asian Countries. This mission, who will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocate to Africa where I live presently. I selected you for this Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of $7,300,000.00 Million US Dollars to you for the development of the well being of handicapped in the society and also as aids for the less privileged around your country, and i have map out $1,700.000.00 for your own personal use to help me for this work.  Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security Bank. Therefore, I forward to you immediate application for the transfer of the money in your name or your home. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use, than enhancement of the comfort of the Handicapped. Lastly, I want you/your home to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without God one's life is vanity upon vanity. I await your reply.Mrs. Saleh Galal "

         "     I am Barrister Omoego Darris, an International Legal Practitioner and a Consultant to Mr. Shouwkat Kahlil, a Lebanese Importer of Textiles and Automobiles, based in Cotonou,Republic of Benin for the past twenty years. Unfortunately, my client Mr Shouwkat Kahlil was one of the passengers that died in the ill-fated plane crash involving a Boeing 727 UTA chartered flight that took off from Cotonou, Republic of Benin and crashed into the Atlantic ocean on Thursday, 25 December 2003. For details of the plane crash,please visit :http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.htmlBefore the untimely death of my client, he had through a security company here in Cotonuo moved the sum of US$20.5m to Europe and was toproceed to Netherlands immediately after the Holiday to complete arrangements and have this money Deposited into ABN AMRO BANK and already the security company where the funds was deposited has sent notice to me requesting that this funds should be claimed by the depositor (My Client) or his next of kin within 14 working days, else the fund will be forfeited to the state. I must confess to you that if I do not find a way to bring this fund out of the Finance Company, I will be doing the greatest injustice to my late friend and his family. this is why I decided to you to stand in as a next of kin or his business partner who was supposed to receive the funds for investment in Europe. There are no risks involved as I am the only person who has access to my client's documents. The Finance firm has just sent a reminder to my client through me, informing him of the maturity of his fund. Your compensation for your assistance in securing the fund is subject to negotiations. I need the following information from you. Your full names,address,telephone and Fax numbers. Also Copy of your Identification. Reply urgently, as we must conclude this transaction within the next 14 working days Sincerely,Barrister Omoego Darris.___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site- http://yoursite.com"

The answer of course is nobecause this is riot about geography. Two veteran intelligence operatives with much Middle Eastern and Afghanexperience speaking not for attribution agreed a stable secure Afghanistan doesn't change the equation at leastnot significantly.The popular perception of al-Qaida in Afghanistan is the same propaganda news clip shown a gazillion timesover the last eight years replete with terrorist \"trainees\" in shalwar-kameez (knee-length shirts over baggypantaloons) running through obstacle courses and emerging from tunnels presumably to kill us all in our beds.Al-Qaida doesn't need commando-steeled volunteers to attack the United States and its allies. For the next Sept.11 the chances are they have already selected highly motivated brainwashed wackjobs among the graduates ofPakistan's madrassas who look forward to a one button push to the land of plenty in the sky where 72 impatientmaidens await their arrival. Al-Qaida's \"martyrs\" don't need Afghan training camps for WMD terrorism. In factto be inconspicuous they should not have the physique of an avoid-at-all-cost likely to arouse suspicion.Al-Qaida does not need Afghanistan for its next terrorist objective. In fact those who follow events inAfghanistan closely were taken aback when Obama said Afghanistan was a war of necessity because that'swhere al-Qaida. is. They haven't been there since Afghanistan was liberated in October 2001. They moved toPakistan's tribal areas where they attracted volunteers from the Middle East and Europe. When a reconstitutedTaliban insurgent force re-entered Afghanistan in large numbers in 2004 al-Qaida was not interested in its nowinsecure old training camps. Even if Pakistan's current offensive.against the Taliban and al-Qaida in the tribalareas is successful al-Qaida is not an entity that can be captured or destroyed. Its clandestine operatives arewidely scattered in the Middle East Africa Europe North and South America.As alternatives to Afghanistan and Pakistan Yemen in the vernacular of the intelligence community will do/isdoing it. Somalia will do/is doing it. West African states whose writ doesn't extend much beyond their capitalswill do/are doing it. Grimy North African suburbs of major French cities will do/are doing it. British provincialtowns with Pakistani enclaves will do/are doing it. And the Internet's thousands of pro-al-Qaida Web sites willdo/are doing it.Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be comfortably installed in a tribal chiefscompound somewhere near Quetta the capital of Pakistan's constantly rebellious Baluchistan province whichhas 48 percent of the country's land with. only 10 million of its 175 million people. There is no al-Qaida centralissuing orders to thousands of adherents the world over.If the:re is no connection between Afghanistan and the core problem of \"no more Sept. lls\" what are the UnitedStates and 41 friendly nations doing there? Even in the event of a Taliban victory in the years to come theTaliban would not be stupid enough to invite al-Qaida back. Three months prior to Sept. 11 2001 there waspalpable tension between Taliban leader Mullah Omar and bin Laden. Omar complained that bin Laden wasissuing \"too many fatwas (religious edicts) which he has no business doing as he didn't complete his religiouseducation.\" Omar also prevented journalists from seeing bin Laden. The Taliban leader knows he lost powerand his country because of what bin Laden and his terrorists did to the United States.In today's Afghanistan almost everything turns out to be corruption and mismanagement. The average citizenhas seen little benefit from expenditures in the $250 billion range -- on top of $1 trillion in Iraq. The .U.S. efforthas been plagued by fraud laced with mismanagement and bereft of strategic focus. One example among manyothers came in 2007 when the United States awarded a massive contract worth some $300 million to A:EY aFlorida-based company to supply the Afghan army with 52 types of ammo chiefly bullets for AK-47s. Allrequirements for safety inspections mandatory for all ammo delivered to U.S. forces were removed. Thus AEYwas able to shop around in Eastern Europe for the cheapest ammo available. Millions of rounds of old Chineseammo made in the 1960s turned out to be substandard. and dangerous.The State Department was aware of what was going on but did not object as speed was the only criterion. AEYand its officers were eventually indicted in Florida. But U.S. officials involved got off with a slap on the wrist.Wherever U.S. inspectors look they find fraud and abuse. There are even cases -- reported by GlobalPostreporter Jean Mackenzie -- of American contractors paying bribes to the Taliban to ensure aid projects are notdisrupted. This is a recipe for a war without end. She also reports a disguised Taliban office in Kabul thatreviews all aid projects and determines the amount to be paid to the Taliban.If true the United States is paying the Afghan government to fight the Taliban while also paying the Taliban tofight the Afghan government.The key lies in Pakistan. Almost all terrorist trails in Europe lead back to Pakistan -- and its madrassas. Theseare the free Koranic schools that have stepped into the vacuum of no education system for the poor as themilitary takes up 50 percent of government revenue. A fraction of what the United States has spent in Iraq andAfghanistan would go a long way to turning Pakistan around. Instead Congress in its infinite wisdom afterauthorizing $1.2 trillion in both wars allocated $7.5 billion to Pakistan over five years -- with umpteen caveats.In a country of 175 million a drop in the proverbial bucket."

Tories desperately do not want Blair there want to run their ownEuropean policy mostly anti-EU and indeed break with past and continuity on Europe.

SLondon TimesOctober 22 2009`Appointing Blair as EU president will haveconsequences' warns HagueWilliam Hague's strident attack on his fellow Briton reportedly left some of the EU ambassadors baffledFrancis Elliott David Charter and Tom BaldwinWilliam Hague has been conducting a behind-the-scenes campaign to convince European ambassadors that Tony Blairwould be a bad choice for European Union president The Times has learnt. The Shadow Foreign Secretary used a lunchorganised by the Swedish presidency in London last week to lobby the most senior diplomats of the 26 other EU nationsagainst the appointment.EU leaders had hoped to choose the new president at next week's summit but the Czech Republic's last-minuteobjections to the Lisbon treaty have scuppered that. President Sarkozy of France wants a quick decision however and isunderstood to be pushing for a special one-day summit in Brussels next month to fill the new post.In making the Conservatives' case against Mr Blair Mr Hague said that while in Downing Street the former Prime Ministerhad consistently placed a higher priority on US interests than on those of Europe. Mr Hague also reminded the diplomatsof Mr Blair's actions in the run-up to the Iraq war according to one of those attending the lunch last Thursday.A claim that Mr Hague told the ambassadors that the Tories would regard Mr Blair's appointment as a \"declaration of war\"by the EU was denied however. A spokesman for Mr Hague said that the phrase was \"a bit strong\". Nevertheless it wasnot disputed that Mr Hague made clear that the move would have consequences for relations between Britain andBrussels. Diplomats said that there was a \"clear mark of hostility\".\"Mr Hague wanted to leave the ambassadors in no doubt that the Conservative Party is opposed to the appointment ofTony Blair as president of the European Council and [that] it would only underline the lack of accountability and legitimacyinvolved in the creation of the position in the first place\" Mr Hague's spokesman said. Mr Hague's strident attack on hisfellow Briton reportedly left some of the ambassadors baffled.Mr Hague is currently in Washington for talks with members of the Obama Administration including Hillary Clinton theSecretary of State with whom he raised the issue of the Conservatives' membership of a right-wing alliance of Europeanparties with allegedly anti-Semitic members.

ChINEDU CHARLE  87b  RIDER HAGGARD CLOSEJOHANAESBURG,SOUTH AFFRICA  ATTN:     In order to transfer out (US$90 Million)niety million United States Dollars) from ALL TRUST BANK (AT).I have picked-up the trust and courage to write you this letter with devine confidence that you are a reliable and honest person who will be capable for this important business transaction believing also that you will never let me down either now or in the future.      My name is dr morries adams a senior Auditing Officerwith the ALL TRUST BANK in South Africa. There is an account opened in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has operated on this account again. After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Fernando Carlos, a foreigner, he was a miner at Kruger gold company, a geologist by profession, and he died since 1990.      No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (US$90 million)niety million United States Dollars.      I want to first transfer (US$45 Million)forty five million United States Dollars from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest. I am contacting you based on the fact that you are a foreigner because this money can only be approved for payment to a foreigner, more so it can not be approved by any local bank here, as this money is in US Dollars hence the former owner of this account is a foreigner too.      I know that this proposal will come to you as a surprise as we don't know ourselves before, however i got your contact from your Embassy's Commercial AttachÃ¯Â¿Â½ I was meant to understand that your race are trustworthy however I did not disclose the purpose of my intention to anybody in the Embassy.Although we will still have to meet possibly, sign some agreement before the final transfer of the fund into any of your chosen designated bank account.     I have involved a very senior official in the operational department and we have agreed that after the transfer of the money into your account, you shallbe entitled to 25% of the total sum, we the officials will take 70% while 5% is for expenses. All necessary precautions have been taken to ensure a risk freesituation on the side of the both parties. Please note that this deal can only take place on the following conditions:-     1.you will provide the bank account and other relevant particulars/information for easy and onward Remittance of this money.     2.absolute confidentiality and sincerity will be required and guaranteed, considering our (me and my partners) positions in the bank.     3.Assurance that our own due share will be released to us in good faith when this money finally gets into your account. This transaction will last for some days as soon as we hear from you.     Please treat with utmost confidentiality. Contact me as quickly as possible through my e-mail box.  Expecting your urgent response,     Best Regards,     Yours faithfully,  DR. CHINEDU CHARLE\t\t--------------------------------- All new Yahoo!

         "TRANSFER OF 36,759,000.00 MILLION POUNDS TO YOURACCOUNT.My name is Mr.Jason Leicester and I work in the International Operation Department in a Bank here in London.I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important business.Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However, this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated as such. At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, a program leader.Until his death,The Late PrimeMinister, Mr. Rafik Hariri, has a huge investment here in the United Kingdom and all over the world, as a matter of fact he has the sum of(THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) in his account here in London which he deposited as a family valuables.The family do not know about this deposit.I was on a routine inspection that I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody will come again for the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder, Therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide all necessary information needed in order to claim this money.Hoping in God that you will never let me down now and in future.o.k! Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri (November 1, 1944 - February 14, 2005), married to Nazek Audi Hariri, was a Lebanese self-made billionaire and business tycoon, and was five times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) before his last resignation from office on October 20,2004. The late Rafik Hariri died on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kg of C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the Saint George Hotel i n the Lebanese capital, for more information please log on to (http://www.hariri.info/)I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER WHOM I CAN TRUST, I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW OURSELVES BEFORE, BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS. I CONTACT YOU BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NOT LET ME DOWN ONCE THE FUND GOES INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.Best Regards Mr.Jason Leicester .",
