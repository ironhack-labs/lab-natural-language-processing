I am writing you this letter based on the latest development at my bank, which I will like to bring to your personal edification. I am writing you this letter with so much joy and excitement even though my heart goes out to the very powerfuland distinguished gentleman who I was fortunate to have worked for and extremely privileged to have known for numerous years.I am a top official in charge of client accounts in EQUITABLE PCI BANK inside the Philippines.In 2001, my client was going through a horrendous divorce in the United States Of America and Was on the verge of losing most of his estate to his vicious and diabolical wife. As a result of this alarming predicament, my client came to me with a very brilliant idea. He transferred some funds, ten million two hundred thousand dollars($10.2m) to a fixed deposit account in my bank under an alias which only the two of us knew about as the confidentiality of the matter was necessary for his protection.Due to his untimely death in early 2002, the funds have been sitting in the account ever since and will continue to do so perpetually unless we do something about it. This is where you come in. I located you through an agency that helps seek people by their email.My client did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paperwork of his bank deposit. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I would like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to our client so that you will be able to receive his funds. I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we can come out successful.I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to my client. All that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full "

         "Dear Friend,Attention Please.Sorry to disturb you. I am Dr Idris Ali, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have been adviced to keep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when I hear from you.I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,Yours faithfully,Dr Idris Ali._________________________________________________________________Windows Live Messenger : venez tester la version bÃ¯Â¿Â½ta ! http://www.ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=5d21c51a-b161-4314-9b0e-4911fb2b2e6d"

I have anurgent and very confidential business proposition for you.  On July 8, 2000, a British Oil consultant/contractor withthe South Korea Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr. PhillipMorris made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelvecalendar months, valued at (Twenty-eight Million ThreeHundred Thousand American Dollars only) in my branch.  Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to hisforwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we senta reminder and finally we discovered from his contractemployers, that Mr. Phillip Morris died from an auto-mobileaccident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died withoutmaking a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin wasfruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered thatMr.Phillip Morris did not declare any kin or relations inall his official documents,including his Bank Depositpaperwork in my Bank.This sum of $28,300,000.00 is stillsitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled overwith the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.  According to Laws of South Korea, at the expiration of (five) years,the money will revert to the ownership of theSouth Korea Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as aforeigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. PhillipMorris so that the fruits of this old man's labor will notget into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will putyou in place as the next of kin. We shall employ theservices of an attorney for drafting and notarization of theWILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter ofprobate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide the will, then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share inthe ratio of 70%for me and 25% for you and 5%  for ExpensesIncurred in the course of the transaction .

I am the first and only son of BRIGADIER VUSI  JONES. I  am presently resident in South Africa.I got your contact address from a business directory  in JohannesburgChamber of commerce and Industry. On  behalf of my widowed mother MRS. ELIZABETHVUSI I  desided to solicit for your assistance to transfer  the sum of US$21.5MILLION( TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE  HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS)inheritedfrom my late father, into your personal company's account.Before my fathers' death, he was a Brigadier in  charge of Arms andAmmunation procurement for the Angola  Army. In his WILL, he specificallydrew my attention  to the said sum of money which he deposited in a  safe box ofa private Security Company in Johannesburg-  South Africa in a treasure box,fully documented in  my name.IN FACT MY FATHER SAID AND I QUOTE  MY BELOVED SON, I WISH TO DRAW YOURATTENTION TO US$21.5 MILLION . I DEPOSITED THE BOX CONTAINING THIS MONEY IN A SECURITYCOMPANY IN JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH  AFRICA. DURING THE WAR, I WAS VERY DEDICATEDAND OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES WERE BUSSY  HELPING THEMSELVES WITHGOVERNMENT FUNDS AND  PROPERTIES AND SENDING THEM TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  DUETO THIS, WHEN I AND MY FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE  PRESIDENT WERE ASSIGNEDBY THE PRESIDENT (EDUARDO  SANTOS) TO PURCHASE ARMS IN SOUTH AFRICA, WE SAW  THISAS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY AND DIVERTED THE MONEY AND  DIVIDED IT. i GOT A TOTAL SUMOF US$21.5 MILLION. IN  CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH, AS A RESULT OF DEATHONLY, YOU SHOULD SOLICIT FOR THE FUND FOR INVESTMENT  PURPOSES.>From the above, you will understand that the lives  and future of my familydepens on this money, as such I  will be grateful if you can assist us. We are nowliving in South Africa as political Asylum seekers and financial laws andregulation of the Republic of  South Africa do not permit us financial rights to suchhuge sum of money. In view of this, I cannot invest this  fund in South africa, hencei am prepared to offer  you 20% of the total fund, while 10% will be set asidefor local and international expenses and 70% will be for  my family and me.Finally, modalities on howthe transfer will be bone  will be conveyed to you once wehave established  trust and confidence between ourselves. Please treat thismatter as very urgent.Best regards,TSEPO VUSI"

I am  MISS maria denise,20years old and the only daughter of my late parents MR.and MRS denise My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2003.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so special.Before his death on Febuary 12 2003 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of Ten Million United State Dollars.(USD$10 000 000) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was decleared as family valuables personal for security reasons. I am just 20years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. Sir,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask you these question:-(1.) Can I completely trust you?Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.Thank you so much.My sincere regards,MISS maria denise.- maria denise"
