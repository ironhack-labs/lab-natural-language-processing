    "### Text Preprocessing: Removing Special Characters, Numbers, and Normalizing Text\n",
    "\n",
    "We further processed the `html_cleaned_text` column to prepare the text for analysis. The following preprocessing steps were applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Removed Special Characters**: Symbols like `@`, `#`, `&`, and punctuation marks were removed.\n",
    "2. **Removed Numbers**: All numeric values were stripped from the text.\n",
    "3. **Removed Single Characters**: Any standalone single letters (e.g., `a`, `b`) were removed.\n",
    "4. **Substituted Multiple Spaces**: Consecutive spaces were replaced with a single space.\n",
    "5. **Converted to Lowercase**: All text was normalized to lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Call It \"Normalized Text\"?\n",
    "The column is called `normalized_text` because these preprocessing steps bring the text into a uniform, consistent format, making it easier to analyze. By removing noise (special characters, numbers, and single letters) and standardizing case and spacing, we ensure the text is clean and ready for downstream tasks like tokenization, stemming, or lemmatization. This process is referred to as **text normalization** in NLP.\n",

    "### **Exploratory Data Analysis: Top Words in SPAM and HAM Messages**\n",
    "\n",
    "The bar charts above illustrate the top 10 most frequent words in SPAM and HAM messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **SPAM Messages:**\n",
    "1. The most frequent words in spam messages include:\n",
    "   - **\"money,\" \"account,\" \"bank,\" \"fund\"**: These words indicate a common theme in spam messages, often targeting financial scams or fraudulent transactions.\n",
    "   - **\"business,\" \"transaction,\" \"country\"**: Suggestive of phishing attempts or fake business proposals.\n",
    "   - **\"transfer,\" \"million\"**: Reflects the language used in scams offering large sums of money.\n",
    "2. These keywords strongly align with the nature of SPAM messages, which are typically designed to deceive recipients.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **HAM Messages:**\n",
    "1. The top words in ham messages include:\n",
    "   - **\"u,\" \"pm,\" \"call\"**: Indicating informal or conversational messages often sent between individuals.\n",
    "   - **\"state,\" \"president,\" \"secretary\"**: Suggests the presence of formal or professional discussions.\n",
    "   - **\"time,\" \"percent,\" \"work\"**: Commonly used in regular, day-to-day conversations or work-related messages.\n",
    "2. The frequency distribution highlights the more natural and contextually diverse vocabulary of HAM messages compared to SPAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- SPAM messages tend to have repetitive patterns with a strong focus on financial and transactional keywords.\n",
    "- HAM messages demonstrate a more balanced and conversational vocabulary, often reflecting normal communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis helps us understand the linguistic differences between SPAM and HAM messages, which will be valuable for building a classification model.\n"

    "### Additional Features: Money Symbols and Suspicious Words\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we enhanced the dataset by adding three additional features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`money_mark`**:\n",
    "   - Indicates the presence of money-related symbols such as \"euro\", \"dollar\", \"pound\", \"€\", and \"$\".\n",
    "   - A value of `1` signifies that one or more of these symbols are present in the text, and `0` indicates their absence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`suspicious_words`**:\n",
    "   - Detects the presence of suspicious words such as \"free\", \"cheap\", \"sex\", \"money\", \"account\", \"bank\", \"fund\", \"transfer\", \"transaction\", \"win\", \"deposit\", and \"password\".\n",
    "   - A value of `1` means that one or more of these words are present, while `0` indicates their absence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`text_len`**:\n",
    "   - Captures the length of the text in the `preprocessed_text` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Observations:\n",
    "- These features can serve as indicators to differentiate SPAM from HAM messages.\n",
    "- For example:\n",
    "  - SPAM messages often contain suspicious words or money-related symbols.\n",
    "  - HAM messages might have fewer suspicious words or no money-related symbols at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample Output:\n",
    "| Index | Preprocessed Text                                  | Label | Money Mark | Suspicious Words | Text Length |\n",
    "|-------|---------------------------------------------------|-------|------------|------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| 29    | ----------- REGARDS, MR NELSON SMITH.KINDLY RE... | 1     | 1          | 0                | 106         |\n",
    "| 535   | I have not been able to reach oscar this am. W... | 0     | 1          | 0                | 101         |\n",
    "| 836   | BANK OF AFRICAAGENCE SAN PEDRO14 BP 1210 S...     | 1     | 1          | 1                | 1750        |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why These Features Matter:\n",
    "- **`money_mark`** and **`suspicious_words`** help identify common patterns in SPAM messages, like references to money or offers too good to be true.\n",
    "- **`text_len`** captures the verbosity of messages, which could be another distinguishing characteristic of SPAM versus HAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step prepares the dataset for feature representation and classification in the subsequent tasks.\n"

    "The **Bag of Words (BoW)** representation transforms the text data into a numerical format that machine learning models can process. Here's what the output tells us:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shape**: The matrix has `1000 rows` (representing the messages) and `20,087 columns` (unique words or tokens across all messages). Each column corresponds to a word, and each row is the BoW representation for a specific message.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Top 10 Features**: The top features identified by the `CountVectorizer` are shown in alphabetical order. These represent some of the unique tokens in the dataset:\n",
    "   - Examples include: `aac`, `aaclocated`, `aae`, etc.\n",
    "   - While some features may seem irrelevant (e.g., typos or uncommon abbreviations), they are still part of the dataset and contribute to the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Importance of BoW**: This representation does not consider the importance of words or their frequencies across all messages. It’s purely a raw count of word occurrences for each message. This method is useful but can lead to sparse and high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Next Steps**: \n",
    "   - We will explore **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** in the next cell, which builds on the BoW representation by giving more weight to important words while reducing the impact of common ones.\n"
