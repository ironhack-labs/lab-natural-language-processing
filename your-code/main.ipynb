In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A d=ollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one= of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on (July 21,= 2003) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have =been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we =cannot =B5 release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or rela=tive on to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines,But unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation d=ied alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the cla=im. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my depar=tment now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the mo=ney to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and su=bsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don=92t want thi=s money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained u=nclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasu=ry as unclaimed fund.

Mr. Hope Sithole one of the Personal Assistants to the young President Joseph Kabila of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), since he assumed power.Sincerely speaking, my agitation is real, and my word is my bond in this proposal. This money in question is part of the budget made by our President Mr. Joseph Kabila, in the fear that members of the United Nations (UN) could perhaps be mandated to offer their respective supports in forcing Iraq to disarm themselves. Eventually, his dreams do not match up with realities and as a result he (the President) started using the money on personal ground because nobody could question/probe his actions, as he believed.</STRONG></DIV><DIV><STRONG>As his closest personal assistant and with the help of two other officials one of whom was the then deputy Director, Safety and Security Department, we were able to escape with two boxes containing the aforementioned sum. At present the boxes were deposited in a reputable Security firm here in South Africa and were registered as family belongings. We had agreed on the need for a foreign assistance with a legitimate bank account abroad, that will stand as, the beneficiary and partner as well in order to avoid suspicion, since we are existing as refugees here. Copies of certificate of Deposit as well as all necessary documents from the Security cc. are available for a hitch-free transaction.</STRONG></DIV><DIV><STRONG>In addition, you are also required to come/send a representative (as far as you trust the person representing) to the Republic of South Africa for the purpose of the transfer, but only if, by one reason or the other you cannot embark on a Five working (5) days trip by yourself, according to the expert from within the bank. As things are now we had not really agreed on the actual amount that should be your remuneration for your kind assistance, which to us is no big deal. The crux of this subject in particular is the declaration of your interest after-which we enter into negotiations with you over the (percentage) issue. Other details of which you may want to know shall be discussed in due course.</STRONG></DIV><DIV><BR><STRONG>Please be kind enough to acknowledge this proposal by responding through the above E-mail address for a high level of confidentiality in this business deal.</STRONG></DIV><DIV><STRONG>Best regards,</STRONG></DIV><DIV><BR><STRONG>Hon.

         ">From Monica YanganiEmail monicayangani250@netscape.netTel 27 8046828612ATTN:Sir/Madam ÃÂ  I know you will be surprised to hear from me, but please consider this as a request from family in dire need of assistance.I am Mrs.Monica Yangani, writing to you from Government Reserved Area (GRA).I got your contact information from the Republic of Congo Chamber of Commerce and Industry. When I was searching for a reliable individual or private company that can assist me to transfer a reasonable amount in a safe account abroad on behalf of my late husband, two sons and two daughters. I decided to solicit your assistance to transfer this sum of US $20 Million (Twenty Million, United States Dollars)inherited from my late husband in to your personal companyÃ¢ÂÂs account or private account.Before his death, he was a Brigadier in charge of arms and ammunition procurement for the (DRC) army. In his WILL?he specifically draws my attention to this US$ 20 Million which he deposited in a safe box in Private Security Company in South Africa. ÃÂ During the war, he was very dedicated and committed to winning the war against the rebels until when he found out that some Senior Army Officers and Government Functionaries were busy helping themselves with government funds and properties and sending them toforeign countries. Due to this, he and his former special advisers to the president were assigned by the President (Laurent Kabila) to purchase arms in South Africa, they saw this as a golden opportunity and diverted the money and divided it and he got a total sum of US $20 Million. He deposited the box in my sonÃ¢ÂÂs name and him alone with the deposit code canclaim it.I will be grateful if you can assist us now. I want you to do for us as an international partner to help us transfer this money which is in a safety box in the Security Company using your name as the beneficiary ofthis sum. You can contact ÃÂ me or my son (George Yangani) ÃÂ inSouth Africa on ÃÂ this number+27 8046828612. Then, we will tell you more details about it. We are in position to inform you of the whole procedures mapped out of the transfer of this money.We have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum for your assistance, 5% for any expenses that might occur from both sides in the course of this transaction,while the remaining 70% will be for my son's investment, which you will assist him to do abroad.Further information and arrangement will commence as soon as trust, confidence and good relationship will be established and safety of this fund assured when transferred to your account.Please treat this matter with utmost urgency.May Allah (God) bless you as I earnestly hope for yourassistance.

I DEPOSITED THE BOX CONTAINING THIS MONEY IN A SECURITYCOMPANY IN JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH  AFRICA. DURING THE WAR, I WAS VERY DEDICATEDAND OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES WERE BUSSY  HELPING THEMSELVES WITHGOVERNMENT FUNDS AND  PROPERTIES AND SENDING THEM TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  DUETO THIS, WHEN I AND MY FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE  PRESIDENT WERE ASSIGNEDBY THE PRESIDENT (EDUARDO  SANTOS) TO PURCHASE ARMS IN SOUTH AFRICA, WE SAW  THISAS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY AND DIVERTED THE MONEY AND  DIVIDED IT. i GOT A TOTAL SUMOF US$21.5 MILLION.

         "<DIV><DIV>Hello my dear</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>I wish to solicit your kind and urgent assistance.My name is Mr.PATRICK AGOLO, a lawyer based in Lagos State of Nigeria.As a lawyer, I was a private legal adviser (for almost two decades) to a white couple who unfortunately lost their lives 3-months ago in a ghastly motor accident here in Nigeria. Prior to their death, this white couple had lived in this country since the 1960?s as missionaries and educationists. Unfortunately, they died childless, with no knownrelatives or next of kin.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>The issue at stake, for which I am writing you now, is that the deceased left behind the sum of US$7.8million in their joint account with ECO INTERNATIONAL BANK Nigeria Incorporated.<BR>Soon after the burial of the deceased, I had promptly notified the bank,which is awaiting me to present to them the person that is to inherit the account of the deceased.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Incidentally, as I said before, the late couple had no known next of kin or relatives. No one else knows about this.However, it will amount to abuse of privilege for me to lay claim to the wealth and estate of the deceased, since as a black man i couldn't have been their relative. But then funds can't be left to the bank permanently/forever. So I have decided to contact you, to seek your consent to present your name to the bank as the next of kin and the appointed administrator/inheritor of the estates of the deceased.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;As a whiteman, you'll fit into the picture.As the lawyer to the deceased, no body can disbelieve me if i present you as the next of kin to the deceased. Moreover, I know the exact legal requirements and documents to secure in your favour to show proof that you are actually the next of kin/inheritor of everything left behind by the deceased. All these will be my responsibility to obtain from the court here in Nigeria. You won?t be needed here in person.</DIV><DIV>I can assure you that this is my specialty and there is nothing for you to be afraid of. I will handle and provide for all that it will take legally.Once everything needful is done, the bank will be satisfied to transfer the monies from the account of the deceased to yours.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>My interest is to take 60% of the funds while you take 30%, while the remaining 10% will be disbursed to any Orphanage-Home of our common choice.Please communicate your decision to me urgently, indicating your Telephone number in your reply so that I can call you and talk this thing over with you.</DIV><DIV>Pls. keep these disclosures confidential.<BR>Thank you.<BR></DIV><DIV>Sincerely yours,<BR>Barrister PATRICK AGOLO(ESQ)</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV><p>\t\t<hr size=1>Do you Yahoo!?<br> Read only the mail you want - <a href=\"http://us.rd.yahoo.com/mail_us/taglines/spamguard/*http://promotions.yahoo.comew_mail/static/protection.html\">Yahoo!

         "Dear Sir or Madam:We are keenly interested in setting up a new factory to produce 120,000 ERW oil casings per year to meet the big market of Shengli Oilfied. Since we lack some starting-up capital, we are seeking for investments. I will give you a brief introduction to the project as follow:I. Background:Shengli Oilfield, the second largest oilfield in China and the leading company of Sinopec Corp.

It is expected that the total oil casing needed in the above area is about 400,000 tons, including 260,000 tons in Sinopec and 150,000 tons in Shengli Oilfield. To meet the great need, we plan to set up a joint venture to produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings per year in Shengli Oilfield.

My name is Ron Sinclear, i was the Personal Assistance to the    (Haitian) President . I apologize if I have infringed on your privacy. It may interest you to know that the former president of (Haiti) has been fighting serious  war for United  Democracy  for quite some years now, which has been backed (all along) by some foreign powerful countries.Not quite long ago, the American government ordered  (President, Jean Bertrand Aristed) to leave  (Haiti) or be forced out of power by a Rabel force.Knowing fully well the capabilities of America and other powerful members of the United Nations, (President Aristed) decided,and left the seat of power  into exile in South Africa country to seek asylum. now a new government is in place . In the light of all these sad happenings, there was this deposit he made with a Security Company in Europe in year May 2001 ,this took place while he was still in power as the president of Haiti, through my aid, his Personal Assistant, (Ron Sinclear) and some loyalist, he suceeded to secretely move the sum of ($9.5M USD) (NINE MILLION,FIVE HUNDERED THOUSAND, UNITED STATES DOLLARS] to a private security company vault in Europe. Now, we need your services as  a highly reliable foreigner to receive the funds into your bank account for the future survival of my family because he (Aristed)  cannot presently operate any foreign bank account in his name. These funds (US$9.5m USD.) arose from various money i received from the sales of diamonds deals, i had with ( President Charles Taylor) of Liberia, which are abound in great quantity around the coastal areas of  liberia.  I have decided that if you are able assist us,you shall be compensated with 25% commission of the funds, 5% of this money shall be set aside to take care of any local or foreign expenses that might be incurred along the line. My family will have the remaining 75% of the funds.

I am just 20years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.

         "Dear Sir, I am aware that this letter will come to you as somewhat of a surprise, but I apologize to you if I have encroached in your privacy. My name is Mr. Jonathan Masin (from Harare, Zimbabwe) and I got your address through the Bloemfontein refuge camp information centre. I am the first son of late Dr Joel Masin, a farmer and business man who died in September 2003 as a result of the land dispute in my country, Zimbabwe. My father used to be a very good friend of Mr. Robert Mugabe until the government introduced the land use decree which enforced the seizure of all white owned farms. Due to my fathers, and other eminent persons opposition to the land use act which was well pronounced all over the world, even up to date, Mr. Mugabe became my fathers worst enemy, he seized his farm and imprisoned him for a long time.After the legal institution of my country found my father not guilty and he was released, Mr. Mugabe used his powers as the president and plotted the assassination of my father in his farm. He was burnt to ashes and his remain were thrown into the bore hole in his farm. We discovered this and wrote several petitions against the government. Knowing that this petition has reached a very heated stage, Mr Mugabe decided to eliminate my entire family. My sister and brother were kidnapped from their school and until today, they have not been found. I ran to South Africa with my sick mother and two other younger ones and came to this refugee camp, where we have been since December 2003. Why I am writing you are that, when my father was alive, he took me to South Africa and we visited a security company where he lodged a consignment which he informed me was loaded with the sum of US$20,500,000 (TWENTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS). This money wasgotten from the sale of several of his farm machinery in combination with that of a few of his white friends whose family could not finally make it out of Zimbabwe (they were all killed secretly).They had to sell off their machinery to avoid seizure and also to ensure that they do not loose all they acquired in life. My request here is to seek your assistance to retrieve this consignment from the security company. As a refugee, I can do nothing about it and to lay claim to it will be a big problem for my family, since Mr. Mugabe is still in power. We have contacted a financial adviser who has agreed to process the necessary legal documents to assist you claim this consignment as your own. The security company does not know the contents as it was deposited by my father as diplomatic valuables.Our intention is to ensure that this money gets into a bank and as refugees we cannot operate bank accounts. We shall offer you 20% of the total amount for all your efforts and there is no single risk what so ever involved. If you are willing and kind enough to assist us, please contact us on above email, fax number. The fax number is a direct one and we use it personally through the financial adviser. I hope seriously that you consider this as ways to assist us get out of the mess we are in. Thank you as i wait foryour urgent reply. RegardsJonathan Masin",

Before his death on 12th june 2005, he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him th at he has the sum of six million,seven hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$6.700,000) deposit security company in Europe.He further told him that hedeposited the money in my name,and finally issued a written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in possession of all the necessary but legal documents to this fund and the security firm.     I am just 19years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what  to do.Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this funds.

         "Dear, Friend.My proposal to you will be very surprising, as we have not had any Personal contact before. However, I sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction,which I propose to you as a person of transparency,honesty and high caliber. Let me first start by introducing myself properly to you. My name is Ron Sinclear, i was the Personal Assistance to the    (Haitian) President . I apologize if I have infringed on your privacy. It may interest you to know that the former president of (Haiti) has been fighting serious  war for United  Democracy  for quite some years now, which has been backed (all along) by some foreign powerful countries.Not quite long ago, the American government ordered  (President, Jean Bertrand Aristed) to leave  (Haiti) or be forced out of power by a Rabel force.Knowing fully well the capabilities of America and other powerful members of the United Nations, (President Aristed) decided,and left the seat of power  into exile in South Africa country to seek asylum. now a new government is in place . In the light of all these sad happenings, there was this deposit he made with a Security Company in Europe in year May 2001 ,this took place while he was still in power as the president of Haiti, through my aid, his Personal Assistant, (Ron Sinclear) and some loyalist, he suceeded to secretely move the sum of ($9.5M USD) (NINE MILLION,FIVE HUNDERED THOUSAND, UNITED STATES DOLLARS] to a private security company vault in Europe. Now, we need your services as  a highly reliable foreigner to receive the funds into your bank account for the future survival of my family because he (Aristed)  cannot presently operate any foreign bank account in his name. These funds (US$9.5m USD.) arose from various money i received from the sales of diamonds deals, i had with ( President Charles Taylor) of Liberia, which are abound in great quantity around the coastal areas of  liberia.  I have decided that if you are able assist us,you shall be compensated with 25% commission of the funds, 5% of this money shall be set aside to take care of any local or foreign expenses that might be incurred along the line. My family will have the remaining 75% of the funds. It might also interest you to note that all security arrangements regarding this  transaction has been put in place, therefore,you have nothing whatsoever to fear or worry about, as every arrangement will be co-handled by you and my former Personal Assistant (Ron Sinclear) who is now presentely in Europe The Netherlands for possible conclusion of this arrangement.Most part of this share (70%) for my family will also be invested in a lucrative business courtesy of your full advice, assistance and connections because that is the most importat part of this transaction. As you indicate interest to assist my family,please kindly send to us your telephone/fax numbers for further discussion and clarification.I will be expecting to receive your urgent response for us to proceed to more details on .this pending transaction.

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally wediscovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National PetroleumCorporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an=20automobile accident.=20On further investigation, I found out that he died without making aWILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. Itherefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kellydid not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.=20This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and theinterest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of eachyear.

         "Dear Sir, I am aware that this letter will come to you as somewhat of a surprise, but I apologize to you if I have encroached in your privacy. My name is Mr. Jonathan Masin (from Harare, Zimbabwe) and I got your address through the Bloemfontein refuge camp information centre. I am the first son of late Dr Joel Masin, a farmer and business man who died in September 2003 as a result of the land dispute in my country, Zimbabwe. My father used to be a very good friend of Mr. Robert Mugabe until the government introduced the land use decree which enforced the seizure of all white owned farms. Due to my fathers, and other eminent persons opposition to the land use act which was well pronounced all over the world, even up to date, Mr. Mugabe became my fathers worst enemy, he seized his farm and imprisoned him for a long time.After the legal institution of my country found my father not guilty and he was released, Mr. Mugabe used his powers as the president and plotted the assassination of my father in his farm. He was burnt to ashes and his remain were thrown into the bore hole in his farm. We discovered this and wrote several petitions against the government. Knowing that this petition has reached a very heated stage, Mr Mugabe decided to eliminate my entire family. My sister and brother were kidnapped from their school and until today, they have not been found. I ran to South Africa with my sick mother and two other younger ones and came to this refugee camp, where we have been since December 2003. Why I am writing you are that, when my father was alive, he took me to South Africa and we visited a security company where he lodged a consignment which he informed me was loaded with the sum of US$20,500,000 (TWENTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS). This money wasgotten from the sale of several of his farm machinery in combination with that of a few of his white friends whose family could not finally make it out of Zimbabwe (they were all killed secretly).They had to sell off their machinery to avoid seizure and also to ensure that they do not loose all they acquired in life. My request here is to seek your assistance to retrieve this consignment from the security company. As a refugee, I can do nothing about it and to lay claim to it will be a big problem for my family, since Mr. Mugabe is still in power. We have contacted a financial adviser who has agreed to process the necessary legal documents to assist you claim this consignment as your own. The security company does not know the contents as it was deposited by my father as diplomatic valuables.Our intention is to ensure that this money gets into a bank and as refugees we cannot operate bank accounts. We shall offer you 20% of the total amount for all your efforts and there is no single risk what so ever involved. If you are willing and kind enough to assist us, please contact us on above email, fax number. The fax number is a direct one and we use it personally through the financial adviser. I hope seriously that you consider this as ways to assist us get out of the mess we are in. Thank you as i wait foryour urgent reply. RegardsJonathan Masin",

         "Dear, Friend.My proposal to you will be very surprising, as we have not had any Personal contact before. However, I sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction,which I propose to you as a person of transparency,honesty and high caliber. Let me first start by introducing myself properly to you. My name is Ron Sinclear, i was the Personal Assistance to the    (Haitian) President . I apologize if I have infringed on your privacy. It may interest you to know that the former president of (Haiti) has been fighting serious  war for United  Democracy  for quite some years now, which has been backed (all along) by some foreign powerful countries.Not quite long ago, the American government ordered  (President, Jean Bertrand Aristed) to leave  (Haiti) or be forced out of power by a Rabel force.Knowing fully well the capabilities of America and other powerful members of the United Nations, (President Aristed) decided,and left the seat of power  into exile in South Africa country to seek asylum. now a new government is in place . In the light of all these sad happenings, there was this deposit he made with a Security Company in Europe in year May 2001 ,this took place while he was still in power as the president of Haiti, through my aid, his Personal Assistant, (Ron Sinclear) and some loyalist, he suceeded to secretely move the sum of ($9.5M USD) (NINE MILLION,FIVE HUNDERED THOUSAND, UNITED STATES DOLLARS] to a private security company vault in Europe. Now, we need your services as  a highly reliable foreigner to receive the funds into your bank account for the future survival of my family because he (Aristed)  cannot presently operate any foreign bank account in his name. These funds (US$9.5m USD.) arose from various money i received from the sales of diamonds deals, i had with ( President Charles Taylor) of Liberia, which are abound in great quantity around the coastal areas of  liberia.

         "Dear, Friend.My proposal to you will be very surprising, as we have not had any Personal contact before. However, I sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction,which I propose to you as a person of transparency,honesty and high caliber. Let me first start by introducing myself properly to you. My name is Ron Sinclear, i was the Personal Assistance to the (Haitian) President . I apologize if I have infringed on your privacy. It may interest you to know that the former president of (Haiti) has been fighting serious war for United Democracy for quite some years now, which has been backed (all along) by some foreign powerful countries.Not quite long ago, the American government ordered (President, Jean Bertrand Aristed) to leave (Haiti) or be forced out of power by a Rabel force.Knowing fully well the capabilities of America and other powerful members of the United Nations, (President Aristed) decided,and left the seat of power into exile in South Africa country to seek asylum. now a new government is in place . In the light of all these sad happenings, there was this deposit he made with a Security Company in Europe in year May 2001 ,this took place while he was still in power as the president of Haiti, through my aid, his Personal Assistant, (Ron Sinclear) and some loyalist, he suceeded to secretely move the sum of ($9.5M USD) (NINE MILLION,FIVE HUNDERED THOUSAND, UNITED STATES DOLLARS] to a private security company vault in Europe. Now, we need your services as a highly reliable foreigner to receive the funds into your bank account for the future survival of my family because he (Aristed) cannot presently operate any foreign bank account in his name. These funds (US$9.5m USD.) arose from various money i received from the sales of diamonds deals, i had with ( President Charles Taylor) of Liberia, which are abound in great quantity around the coastal areas of liberia. I have decided that if you are able assist us,you shall be compensated with 25% commission of the funds, 5% of this money shall be set aside to take care of any local or foreign expenses that might be incurred along the line. My family will have the remaining 75% of the funds.

         "Dear Sir, I am aware that this letter will come to you as somewhat of a surprise, but I apologize to you if I have encroached in your privacy. My name is Mr. Jonathan Masin (from Harare, Zimbabwe) and I got your address through the Bloemfontein refuge camp information centre. I am the first son of late Dr Joel Masin, a farmer and business man who died in September 2003 as a result of the land dispute in my country, Zimbabwe. My father used to be a very good friend of Mr. Robert Mugabe until the government introduced the land use decree which enforced the seizure of all white owned farms. Due to my fathers, and other eminent persons opposition to the land use act which was well pronounced all over the world, even up to date, Mr. Mugabe became my fathers worst enemy, he seized his farm and imprisoned him for a long time.After the legal institution of my country found my father not guilty and he was released, Mr. Mugabe used his powers as the president and plotted the assassination of my father in his farm. He was burnt to ashes and his remain were thrown into the bore hole in his farm. We discovered this and wrote several petitions against the government. Knowing that this petition has reached a very heated stage, Mr Mugabe decided to eliminate my entire family. My sister and brother were kidnapped from their school and until today, they have not been found. I ran to South Africa with my sick mother and two other younger ones and came to this refugee camp, where we have been since December 2003. Why I am writing you are that, when my father was alive, he took me to South Africa and we visited a security company where he lodged a consignment which he informed me was loaded with the sum of US$20,500,000 (TWENTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS). This money wasgotten from the sale of several of his farm machinery in combination with that of a few of his white friends whose family could not finally make it out of Zimbabwe (they were all killed secretly).They had to sell off their machinery to avoid seizure and also to ensure that they do not loose all they acquired in life. My request here is to seek your assistance to retrieve this consignment from the security company. As a refugee, I can do nothing about it and to lay claim to it will be a big problem for my family, since Mr. Mugabe is still in power. We have contacted a financial adviser who has agreed to process the necessary legal documents to assist you claim this consignment as your own. The security company does not know the contents as it was deposited by my father as diplomatic valuables.Our intention is to ensure that this money gets into a bank and as refugees we cannot operate bank accounts. We shall offer you 20% of the total amount for all your efforts and there is no single risk what so ever involved. If you are willing and kind enough to assist us, please contact us on above email, fax number. The fax number is a direct one and we use it personally through the financial adviser. I hope seriously that you consider this as ways to assist us get out of the mess we are in. Thank you as i wait foryour urgent reply. RegardsJonathan Masin",

However, I sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction,which I propose to you as a person of transparency,honesty and high caliber. Let me first start by introducing myself properly to you. My name is Ron Sinclear, i was the Personal Assistance to the    (Haitian) President . I apologize if I have infringed on your privacy. It may interest you to know that the former president of (Haiti) has been fighting serious  war for United  Democracy  for quite some years now, which has been backed (all along) by some foreign powerful countries.Not quite long ago, the American government ordered  (President, Jean Bertrand Aristed) to leave  (Haiti) or be forced out of power by a Rabel force.Knowing fully well the capabilities of America and other powerful members of the United Nations, (President Aristed) decided,and left the seat of power  into exile in South Africa country to seek asylum. now a new government is in place . In the light of all these sad happenings, there was this deposit he made with a Security Company in Europe in year May 2001 ,this took place while he was still in power as the president of Haiti, through my aid, his Personal Assistant, (Ron Sinclear) and some loyalist, he suceeded to secretely move the sum of ($9.5M USD) (NINE MILLION,FIVE HUNDERED THOUSAND, UNITED STATES DOLLARS] to a private security company vault in Europe. Now, we need your services as  a highly reliable foreigner to receive the funds into your bank account for the future survival of my family because he (Aristed)  cannot presently operate any foreign bank account in his name. These funds (US$9.5m USD.) arose from various money i received from the sales of diamonds deals, i had with ( President Charles Taylor) of Liberia, which are abound in great quantity around the coastal areas of  liberia.  I have decided that if you are able assist us,you shall be compensated with 25% commission of the funds, 5% of this money shall be set aside to take care of any local or foreign expenses that might be incurred along the line. My family will have the remaining 75% of the funds. It might also interest you to note that all security arrangements regarding this  transaction has been put in place, therefore,you have nothing whatsoever to fear or worry about, as every arrangement will be co-handled by you and my former Personal Assistant (Ron Sinclear) who is now presentely in Europe The Netherlands for possible conclusion of this arrangement.Most part of this share (70%) for my family will also be invested in a lucrative business courtesy of your full advice, assistance and connections because that is the most importat part of this transaction.

         "Dear Sir, I am aware that this letter will come to you as somewhat of a surprise, but I apologize to you if I have encroached in your privacy. My name is Mr. Jonathan Masin (from Harare, Zimbabwe) and I got your address through the Bloemfontein refuge camp information centre. I am the first son of late Dr Joel Masin, a farmer and business man who died in September 2003 as a result of the land dispute in my country, Zimbabwe. My father used to be a very good friend of Mr. Robert Mugabe until the government introduced the land use decree which enforced the seizure of all white owned farms. Due to my fathers, and other eminent persons opposition to the land use act which was well pronounced all over the world, even up to date, Mr. Mugabe became my fathers worst enemy, he seized his farm and imprisoned him for a long time.After the legal institution of my country found my father not guilty and he was released, Mr. Mugabe used his powers as the president and plotted the assassination of my father in his farm. He was burnt to ashes and his remain were thrown into the bore hole in his farm. We discovered this and wrote several petitions against the government. Knowing that this petition has reached a very heated stage, Mr Mugabe decided to eliminate my entire family. My sister and brother were kidnapped from their school and until today, they have not been found. I ran to South Africa with my sick mother and two other younger ones and came to this refugee camp, where we have been since December 2003. Why I am writing you are that, when my father was alive, he took me to South Africa and we visited a security company where he lodged a consignment which he informed me was loaded with the sum of US$20,500,000 (TWENTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS). This money wasgotten from the sale of several of his farm machinery in combination with that of a few of his white friends whose family could not finally make it out of Zimbabwe (they were all killed secretly).They had to sell off their machinery to avoid seizure and also to ensure that they do not loose all they acquired in life. My request here is to seek your assistance to retrieve this consignment from the security company. As a refugee, I can do nothing about it and to lay claim to it will be a big problem for my family, since Mr. Mugabe is still in power. We have contacted a financial adviser who has agreed to process the necessary legal documents to assist you claim this consignment as your own. The security company does not know the contents as it was deposited by my father as diplomatic valuables.Our intention is to ensure that this money gets into a bank and as refugees we cannot operate bank accounts. We shall offer you 20% of the total amount for all your efforts and there is no single risk what so ever involved. If you are willing and kind enough to assist us, please contact us on above email, fax number. The fax number is a direct one and we use it personally through the financial adviser. I hope seriously that you consider this as ways to assist us get out of the mess we are in. Thank you as i wait foryour urgent reply. RegardsJonathan Masin",

SA. We will start the  first transfer with fifty twomillion [$52,000.000] upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account.The amount involved is (USD 152M) One hundred and Fifty two million United States Dollars only. I want to first transfer $52,000.000 [fifty two million United States Dollars from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, without valid international foreign passport, but can only be approved to a foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money is in US DOLLARS and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Arthur Coleman is a foreigner too, [and the money canonly be approved into a foreign a/c. However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together.  I got your contact address  from my Secretary who operates computer.

But God knows the truth!     My mother died when I was just 6 years old,and since then my father took me so special.
