The only times I seefor me before December are Nov 21-23 or sometime in the second or third weeks of December. I'm copying Cheryl soyou two can try to find a time that works.As to the names I think they're all worth inviting w the hope they can come. Let's do it! Best HJust met with Fr Gudziak. He will come back to Kyiv for your visit!Also John Tefft saw him in Lviv. He is so grateful for the strong support you have delivered.Sent via BlackBerry from T-MobileNo word back from chinese on his availability.Blair will be fine with that.When is Steinberg call?August 27 2012For: HillaryWith your permission we are changing the statement to spokesman's name rather than yours. Makes it a more genericstatement of U.S. policy and holds you in reserve.We have tweaked the first paragraph to make clear our expectation.On Mexico consensus is that a call is worthwhile but we will get you an updated call sheet that accounts for interveningevents.The remaining Honduras related call sheets are also coming your way.Please let me know if I can help with anything else.Also - Ann is sending the number of people you have to include for the KC Honors dinner at the State Dept. Sheconfirmed they pay for the evening but was reluctant to commit to decorations - she will check.Sent via BlackBerry by AT&T--I like that. Can you prepare cover so I can give to him today?FyiNora--Cheryl has emailed dozens of memos about Haiti to me this weekend. Can you please print them and organize them inchrono order for me for my trip tomorrow or send to Lauren so she can do? Thx.There was a garble on the middle east meeting. It's not chiefly on Mitchell travel or related issues. It's chiefly on how todeal with the nuclear issue in the context of the upcoming summit. Though with the players at the table...I will prepare for you to sign next week.

The Chinesecompany will buy a 70 percent share of the whole project according to an agreement signed Sunday in LausanneSwitzerland between CNPC and NIOC's overseas investment subsidiary Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO) that coversa 90 percent stake in the project.A likely explanation would be that this deal has been long in the making. Still Tehran's motivation for releasing thisinformation in English at this time is worth considering.The whole story from an English-language Iranian outlet is pasted in below and I found three Chinese-language sourceswith corroborating reports (nothing in English from China though):http://business.sohu.com/20090929267094148.shtmlhttp://money.163.com/09/0929/14/5KCSKN5F002524SO.htmlhttp://finance.sina.com.cn/world/gjjj/20090929/18566807524.shtmlJackiePress TVIran China sign a major oilfield dealMon 28 Sep 2009 15:05:09 GMTChina National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has signed a contract with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for thedevelopment of Iran's South Azadegan oilfield.The Chinese company will buy a 70 percent share of the whole project according to an agreement signed Sunday inLausanne Switzerland between CNPC and NIOC's overseas investment subsidiary Naftiran lntertrade Company (NICO)that covers a 90 percent stake in the project.CNPC which won a bid in January to develop the North Azadegan oilfield now holds a 70 percent share of the projectwith NICO holding 20 percent and Inpex of Japan having the remaining 10 percent.The South Azadegan project is slated to produce 260000 barrels of crude oil per day and its development will costaround $2.5 billion.The field along the Iraqi border holds reserves estimated at approximately 42 billion barrels of oil one of the world'slargest finds in the last 30 years.Iran provides 14 percent of China's demand for oil.The deal is couched in buy-back terms in which CNPC will hand over the operation of the field to NIOC afterdevelopment and will receive payments from the oil production for a few years to cover its investment.China's investment in Iran's energy sector has increased as some western countries led by the US have sanctioned Iranover its peaceful nuclear program.Jacqueline NewmyerPresident Long Term Strategy Group12 Eliot St. Cambridge MA 02138617-661-1620 (ph)617-661-1626 (fax)www.ltstrategy.comFYIThx.How's it going?

Petraeus takes command in Afghanistan the two top American civilian officials inthe war face an uncertain and tricky future working with a newly empowered military leader under the gaze of animpatient president who has put them on notice that his fractious war council needs to pull together.Richard C. Holbrooke the Obama administration's special representative to the region and Karl W. Eikenberry theambassador to Afghanistan both hung on to their jobs in the uproar that followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's career-ending quotes in Rolling Stone magazine.But privately at least one senior White House official suggested using General McChrystal's exit as an excuse for ahousecleaning according to senior officials. That was rejected as too disruptive during a military campaign that reliesheavily on civilian support these people said.In recent days other administration officials have begun floating the idea that Ambassador Eikenberry might bereplaced byRyan C. Crocker the highly regarded former ambassador in Iraq who forged a close partnership with General Petraeusduring the successful Iraq troop increase.Such a prospect is viewed as remote given Mr. Crocker's prestigious new post atTexas A&M University. But the fact that his name is being invoked underlines the challenges that confront AmbassadorEikenberry as he adapts to a new partner Ã¢ÂÂ one who has strong ideas about how soldiers and diplomats should worktogether in war.It also illustrates the remarkably powerful role that General Petraeus will assume in the nine-year-old war setting himup as almost a viceroy in Afghanistan and a key broker in negotiations between PresidentHamid Karzai and Pakistan over an eventual political settlement.Prior to General Petraeus's arrival some critics said the White House had created a problem by recruiting severalforceful ambitious personalities and giving them jobs with overlapping responsibilities. Administration officialsacknowledge that as one said \"There are obviously a number of substantial personalities on the team.\" But the WhiteHouse believes that the current lineup can mesh and that a difficult war demands this much talent.Still the McChrystal blow-up has reverberated through the State Department. Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke to take a hard look at the civilian teamtwo officials said. She is not wedded to the current lineup if it continues to bog down in internecine battles they said.\"You can't have a major shift in a civ-mil structure without having the civilian side take a step back and look ateverything\" said a senior State Department official using the jargon for a civilian-military campaign.BeGeneral Petraeus whose appointment was approved 99-0 by the Senate on Wednesday took pains at his confirmationhearing on Tuesday to back a unified civilian and military effort. He noted then that he had telephoned Mr. Holbrookeand would rendezvous with Ambassador Eikenberry in Brussels so the two could land in Kabul together.\"Holbrooke has been my wingman to a great degree\" General Petraeus said in an interview. \"We have had and dohave a very good relationship.\" That role he said will now fall to Ambassador Eikenberry.Ambassador Eikenberry was highly critical of the Pentagon's proposal last year to send 60000 additional troops toAfghanistan which led to a difficult relationship with General McChrystal. But in fact General Petraeus was the truearchitect of the plan.The ambassador a retired lieutenant general and former commander in Afghanistan graduated fromWest Point in 1973 a year ahead of General Petraeus but they did not know each other at the academy. The two sharea scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds a Ph.D. from Princeton while Ambassador Eikenberry has Master's degreesfromHarvard and Stanford.While they were never assigned together their careers intersected twice. In Iraq General Eikenberry led an assessmentof Iraqi security forces while General Petraeus was commanding the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul. When GeneralEikenberry was commander in Afghanistan General Petraeus led an assessment of Afghan National Security Forces.General Petraeus declined to discuss personnel issues while Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke turned downrequests for an interview. Mr. Crocker now the dean of the George Bush School of Government at Texas A&M did notreturn a call for comment.For Mr. Holbrooke the new landscape is challenging in other ways. Officials said his job security was less in doubt than itwas six months ago when his ouster was the subject of endless Washington chatter. Yet he has arguably become a lesscentral player:Jacob J. Lew a deputy secretary of state manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr. Holbrooke helpedshape while the embassy in Kabul is carrying it out. Mr. Holbrooke's current portfolio has played to his weaknesses hisown allies admit. He is best as a high-level negotiator and not as comfortable with the nitty-gritty work of helpingAfghanistan build an economy.These days Mr. Holbrooke has become a globe-trotting diplomat trying to retain flagging European allies while seekingto draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt into helping Afghanistan. At a recent conference of 35 countries inMadrid Mr. Holbrooke drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan government's campaign to reintegrateTaliban fighters into mainstream society.Mr. Karzai's longer-term effort to reconcile with Taliban leaders and his negotiations with Pakistan could propel Mr.Holbrooke back into a central role. Were these talks to become more serious several officials said Mr. Holbrooke'snegotiating skills could be put to use as a broker and guardian of American interests. For now though as evidence ofGeneral Petraeus's influence he will do most of the shuttling between Kabul and Islamabad.On his last visit to the region Mr. Holbrooke met with Mr. Karzai and with senior Pakistani officials including the armychief of staffAshfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. Holbrooke's past run-ins with Mr. Karzai several officials said have not hindered his ability todeal with the Afghan leader and Pakistani officials said they trusted him.Husain Haqqani Pakistan's ambassador to Washington said that Mr. Holbrooke took time to understand Pakistan'sconcerns. \"Ambassador Holbrooke is liked by some admired by others and seen as effective even by those who maynot like him\" Mr. Haqqani said.Still General Petraeus is indisputably the key player and he has wasted no time asserting his control. On a securevideoconference call last Saturday a person familiar with the call said General Petraeus threw his support behind acostly and controversial plan to install temporary generators to supply more electricity to Kandahar the Talibanstronghold that is the next major American military target.Mr. Holbrooke and Ambassador Eikenberry swiftly assented.FYII'm trying to call the FM now.And I have 3 letters in my possession that we are handing to Kyl's office now.8:15 am DEPART Private Residence 'En route State Department8:25 am ARRIVE State Department8:25 am PRESIDENTIAL DAILY BRIEFING8:30 am Secretary's Office8:30 am DAILY SMALL STAFF MEETING8:45 am Secretary's Office8:45 am DAILY SENIOR STAFF MEETING9:15 am Secretary's Conference Room9:30 am MEETING w/ERIC GOOSBY10:00 am Secretary's Office10:15 am PHOTOS10:30 am Secretary's Office *Jared Cohen Paul Narain (wife:Julianna Bentes)10:30 am OFFICE TIME11:30 pm Secretary's OfficeYale Alumni (Jake11:30 am PHONE CALL w/ KENYAN PM RAILA ODINGA11:40 am Secretary's Office12:00 pm PHONE CALL w/COLOMBIAN FM MARIA ANGELA HOLGUIN12:10 pm Secretary's Office12:15 pm UNGA MEETING12:45pm Secretary's Outer Office12:45 pm OFFICE TIME1:20pm Secretary's Office1:20 pm (t) DEPART State Department *En route Washington National Airport1:40 pm (t) ARRIVE Washington National Airport2:00 pm (t) DEPART Washington National Airport via US Airways Shuttle #2174En route New York NY3:25 pm (t) ARRIVE New York LaGuardia Airport3:35 pm (t) DEPART LaGuardia Airport *En route Private Residence4:25 pm (t) ARRIVE Private Residence###I'm happy to talk w Shaun anytime.BartholomewB6Marshall Capricia P; Verveer Melanne SRELEASE IN PARTB6Be sure I do a video conf w Chris hill in next few weeks.FY1November 09 2009Samuel J. Heyman who stood out as a corporate raider who preferred to hold on to companies he bought and run themrather that sell them for a quick profit died Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 70.Mr. Heyman's death was confirmed by his wife Ronnie who said he had died after complications from open heartsurgery.Mr. Heyman was most recently chairman of the GAF Corporation a manufacturer of roofing materials and a chemicalcompany that was spun off from GAF called International Specialty Products. Both companies are based in Wayne N.J.A group led by Mr. Heyman bought GAF in 1983 and took it private in 1987 after the stock market crashed. He later spunoff GAF's chemical business into a separate company I.S.P.During that period corporate raiders tended to buy companies cut operational costs and then sell them at a profit. Butafter Mr. Heyman won a battle with GAF's management for control of the company he told The New York Times: \"Thereis a very strong potential in chemicals and we plan to make them grow.\"Mr. Heyman who was also a lawyer had diverse business holdings including Heyman Properties which owns shoppingmalls in the Northeast and which grew out of a business he had inherited from his father.\"He was extremely methodical. There was a rhyme and reason to everything he did\" said Leon Black the chairman ofApollo Management a private equity firm and a longtime friend who was once Mr. Heyman's investment banker.Mr. Black added: \"He combined a strong legal background with a strong analytical business strength and he was a fiercenegotiator. But what really made Sam kick was that he was a builder. It was all about building whether it was hiscompanies his real estate his art collection or his family.\"Mr. Heyman was born March 1 1939 in Danbury Conn. to Annette and Lazarus Heyman. His father was a real estatedeveloper. After graduating from Yale in 1960 and Harvard Law School in 1964 Mr. Heyman went to work in the JusticeDepartment under Robert F. Kennedy and served as chief assistant United States attorney for Connecticut. He had to cutthat career short when his father needed him to take over the real estate development business.Mr. Heyman made his biggest mark in the 1983 battle for GAF. A group of shareholders led by Mr. Heyman becamefrustrated by management's resistance to selling some of its biggest assets including the chemicals business.Mr. Heyman waged an aggressive campaign against the company's chairman and ultimately forced his removal througha shareholder vote - a rare victory for shareholders during a time when executives of public companies were consideredvirtually untouchable.Once Mr. Heyman took control of GAF he reversed course and held on to the chemicals business ultimately making it abig contributor to the company's profit.He also moved quickly to cut costs and revamp the business saying at the time that he was an \"impatient man. When Isee a place where money can be saved I don't waste time.\"Mr. Heyman also gave away money. In 1999 he founded the Partnership for Public Service which provides fellowshipsto encourage students to pursue careers in public service. For his charity work Mr. Heyman won the President's CitizensAward in 2008.His other philanthropic interests included the establishment of the Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Center on CorporateGovernance at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.He and his wife also collected art. Among their holdings are works by Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock.In addition to his wife the former Ronnie Feuerstein Mr. Heyman is survived by his mother Annette Heyman of PalmBeach Fla.; four children Lazarus Heyman Eleanor Propp Jennifer Millstone and Elizabeth Winter; and ninegrandchildren.Ok that's when I will go.

As brieflydiscussed in the meeting today the LGF operate at what I would consider the \"Threshold'Sleep Deprivation. Further meaning that our work schedule hours and sleeping pattern'the LGF very close to the edge of serious sleep deprivation. When we have to work go.time or ramp up extra manpower (during scheduled off days) due to increased threw .etc...etc...; we further compound the issue of sleep deprivation. This ultimately dirninit:LGF's ability to provide security.To better explain here is where it starts the LGF work 3 days then transition (swing shift) into .nights then transition into 3 days off (it used to be 2x2x2). Each work day equals 14 actin I I!(-)of work; Supervisor's can average up to 15 hours per work day.Snap shot of an average day for a shift:1. 05:00hrs every day Shift Brief for on-going shift along with \"In-Service Training\". .IConvoy Brief followed by convoy load time and organization for entire shift (approx iduring the day) followed by actual convoy movement.2. 05:45 to 06:15hrs. (approximately) you have the shift change over on site3. 06:15 to 17:45 regular work day on site.4. 17:45 to 18:15 Shift change over followed by reorganization of convoy for off-going. sliithen actual convoy movement5. 18:30 (approximately) Off-going shift returns to Camp Sullivan weapons and equipment aredown loaded and convoy equipment is stowed vehicle's re-staged in parking lot.6. 19:00 (approximately) Off-going shift is complete all equipment is accounted for andsecured they are then on personnel time whether to work out and train eat dinner watchmovie internet phone calls sleep or etc.7. 10 hours later it starts all over with a 05:00hrs Shift Brief not taking into considers titwake-up and grooming and breakfast.This averages an actual 14 hour day for each LGF member. Some days can be as short ahours and some days as long as 14.5 hours. Supervisor's can average an additional(approximate) 30 minutes prior to and after a shift conducting administrative duties and or ;1organization. All personal hygiene laundry personal e-mail/matters Physical fitness usuallymeals and sleep must be conducted within the 10 hour window between an individual's shifts.After completing the 3 days in a work cycle which ends at 19:00hrs the shifts swings intonight shift schedule. Their next duty starts at 17:00hrs the following day for the eveningbriefmg. This is a 22 hour transition window which most LGF only sleep once and areagain with the same 14 hour schedule for their first night shift. This can be viewed as gea ione good sleep in for a 36 hours window of time (by the end of their first night shift foltwo more night shifts).When finishing their last night shift they are immediately off however do to working ah(arriving back at Camp Sullivan around 06:30) they sleep most of the first day off. They thehave to adjust back into a night-time sleeping pattern. The second day off is a designatedtraining day. Third day is a scheduled off day.If you average this work schedule out over the course of a month an LGF member transitio'from a day to night sleeping pattern on average of 7 times. It's nearly impossible to establishrhythmic sleeping pattern. This is what causes the sleep deprivation. You can see its efftiekover the course of time. When a shift gets back on ground after an R&R they are fresh and rtof energy as compared to a shift that is been in the grind for 7 or 8 weeks and sometint:..after 5 and 6 weeks.In summary a disruption or addition to the current work schedule further compounds t1.sleep deprivation and is not sustainable by the LGF for extended periods of time.Respectfully Werner TheGuard Force Commander US Embassy Kabul AfghanistanArmorGroup North AmericaTel: (+93) 0777715903 (+93) 0799715903ilicstate.gov orSigh - will send you traffic that lead to this responseThanks Madame Secretary --Kagan also had an unusually supportive piece on Friday that prominently mentioned your role on AsiaHe built Singapore from nothing and his book is pretty damn inspirational on that front.I leave for Asia early Monday and will check in from the road.

Last year a friend of mine was invited to aHanukkah party that the Obamas gave for prominent Jews (a group with whom there had been tensions) and after theObamas descended the grand stairway they stood in the foyer briefly; the President made a few remarks and shook afew hands and back up the stairs they went. No mingling.In their first two years the Obamas have seemed a bit tone-deaf: there were too many vacations while people werehurting especially Michelle's extravagant trip to Spain. (I'm as interested in Michelle's clothes as the next woman but atthe same time think she and her staff are too focused on her looking smashing which she does. Her wardrobe seemsquite extensive for these troubled times.)Barack Obama's personality has been much mulled over in the past two years but it seems inescapable that his high self-esteem often slides over the thin line to arrogance which trickles down (with some exceptions) to much of his staff someof whom are downright rude to all but a chosen few. ÃÂ°barna has seemed uninterested in anyone but his immediate groupand three of the four members of his immediate circle--Jarrett Robert Gibbs David AxelrodÃ¢ÂÂhad had no experience ingoverning. The fourth Rahm Emanuel expressed himself with such flippancy arrogance and overuse of the F-word thathe offended not just members of Congress but also would-be allies of the President.Vice President Joe Bider) who is liked on Capitol Hill was virtually shut out of the dealings with people in Congress in thefirst two yearsÃ¢ÂÂ\"I can handle them\" Obama told BidenÃ¢ÂÂbut Biden is now expected to be given a larger role as part of theWhite House's new determination to \"reach out.\" (A few months ago highly placed members of the staff also swore theywould \"reach out\" but that seemed to last for just a few days.) One of the oddest aspects of Obama's persona is thatsomeone who seems so confident has insisted thus far in having people around him with whom he is said to be\"comfortable.\"For example Torn Donilon his recently appointed national security adviser (a promotion from his role as deputy) is by allaccounts a capable man but is no one's idea of a serious strategic thinker. The explanation I was given for Donilon'sbeing given his new position was that \"the President is comfortable with him.\" Just as Obama is described as pleased withhimself he has been treated with hero worship by much of his staff. After all he had taken on the formidable Clintonsand against the expectation of almost all the pundits and the experts he had beaten them. Why should he listen to thosewho had doubted him? A common complaint about the Obama White House in the first two years has been that therewere no \"grown-ups\" around people who knew more about governing and who would tell Obama that he was wrong.When people tried to suggest someone who should be brought in that person was rejected as \"not one of ours.\" JoeBiden is said to argue with Obama on issues such as Afghanistan but not to get into the management of the WhiteHouse....Those who supported Obama in 2008 expected him to be able to move public opinion to get people to follow him. Thefact that the Obama White House has been so poor at \"messaging\" baffles even his strongest supporters. In fact he hadno overall message. As Winston Churchill put it there was no theme to his pudding. When I asked a White House aideabout this he pointed to what had been billed as a \"major speech on the economy\" at Georgetown University in April2009. But the speech was utterly forgettableÃ¢ÂÂand forgotten. One ally attributes this problem to the inexperience of bothObama and his top staff. An ally says \"You can't leave a message if you don't have a strategy and you don't know whereyou're going.\" Another says \"They had something that worked in the campaign but didn't work in the White House.\"Thus Obama didn't see the need to explain what he was doing. His 2010 campaign themes seemed to wander all overthe place: Stanley Greenberg a pollster and former aide to Bill Clinton said that Obama's oft-used theme that weshouldn't go back to the Bush days actually tested negatively because people didn't believe that the country was makingeconomic progress.So Obama's biggest failure was not to be the leader that so many expected him to be. The jubilation that surrounded hisswearing-in may have gone to his head while the celebrants overlooked that there were plenty of people out there whowere not overjoyed at the advent of a black president or even a Democrat. Obama was apparently in his own estimationso smart and so adored that he seems to have felt no need to explainÃ¢ÂÂand explain againÃ¢ÂÂto the country what he wasdoing and to take the country along with him. This failure to put his programs across came up a few times in the 2010campaign....More than once people in town hall meetings told him that they were behind him but were having great trouble trying todefend or explain his agenda. In a backyard gathering on October 21 he made the most awkward reply of those I heard:\"Our attitude was that we just had to get the policies right and we didn't always think about making sure we got theadvertising properly about what was going on.\" Advertising. (When I mentioned this to a Democratic senator who wasgenerally supportive of Obama this ordinarily polite man responded \"Bullocks! What policies?\")The risk-averse Obama had left it to Congress to write the big bills such as on the economic stimulus and health care(with strong participation by White House aides). But he kept up this line of defense all the way through to his patheticpress conference on the day after the election. In these comments Obama gave away the devastating fact that he didn'treally understand the role of the president as leader. A friend of the Obama administration said to me \"Their definition ofgoverning is passing bills.\" Someone else relatively close to the White House explained that since Obama had been socriticized for being \"arrogant\" and \"aloof\" he had to eat large portions of humble pie. (\"And I take responsibility for that\"Obama said again and again.)Hrc - we are going to extend invites tomorrow morning if ok with you?Below is the Iran section of the chair's statement from Trieste.

We express our solidaritywith those who have suffered repression while peacefully demonstrating and urge Iran to respect fundamental humanrights including freedom of expression as ensured by the international treaties it has ratified. The crisis should besettled soon through democratic dialogue and peaceful means on the basis of the rule of law. We call on the Iraniangovernment to guarantee that the will of the Iranian people is reflected in the electoral process.We remain committed to finding a diplomatic solution to the issue of Iran's nuclear program and support renewedefforts to that effect such as the readiness of the U.S. to enter into direct talks and the invitation from China FranceGermany Russia the United Kingdom and the United States to Iran to restart negotiations as well as the constructiveinvolvement of other G8 partners in the process. We stress the need for unity of action on the basis of agreed policy. Wesincerely hope that Iran will seize this opportunity to give diplomacy a chance to find a negotiated solution to thenuclear issue. At the same time we remain deeply concerned over proliferation risks posed by Iran's nuclear programme.We recognise that Iran has the right to a civilian nuclear programme but that comes with the responsibility to restoreconfidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear activities. We strongly urge Iran to cooperate fully with theIAEA and to comply with the relevant UNSC Resolutions.Our meeting on the margin of the United Nations General Assembly opening week next September will be an occasionfor the G8 to take stock of the situation.Be sure I have most updated tps.OkSounds good -- will have copies for you tomorrow morning of those schedules.See WIMills Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>Friday November 5 2010 5:41 AMFw:It should be ready for you.

But I repeat our reunification will occur inside of theEuropean Union and in no other way.\" In 2009 he said \"Who can imagine that a head of Romanian state willsign a treaty to entrench the Molotov-von Ribbentrop Pact?\"During his late January trip to Chisinau Basescu's message on territorial integrity and supportive ofEU integration. He said \"Romania recognized the state borders of the Republic of Moldova inherited from theformer Soviet Union. Romania agrees to sign an agreement in regards to the existent border regime the way itwas inherited from the USSR.\" Romania and Moldova in fact have good relations and no real border issues;the two governments are working on an agreement to make cross-border travel easier for Moldovans.The biggest challenge to Moldova's territorial integrity is Transnistria where de facto authorities rely on thelong-term presence of Russian forces for political support. Moldova's leaders seek a transition to a multilateralpresence and withdrawal of Russian troops but this is not likely without a political settlement on Transnistria'sreintegration.

Ecuador is now on the \"Improving AML/CFT Compliance:On-going Process\" list for showing progress in its efforts against money laundering and financing terrorism.(SBU) According to Treasury the change in Ecuador's status stems from its commitment to an action plan with the FATFand the GOE's demonstrated high-level political commitment to work toward AML/CFT (anti-money laundering Ã¢ÂÂcombating the financing of terrorism) compliance.WHA is looking into options for next steps.Please let me know if you would like any further information.BestMikeMichael H.

President Obama leads Sarah Palin 48 - 40 percent.Romney Huckabee Palin and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich are bunched together when Republicanvoters are asked who they prefer for the GOP's 2012 presidential nomination the independent Quinnipiac(KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University survey finds.Democratic voters say 64 - 27 percent they do not want anyone to challenge President Obama for their party'snomination in 2012.\"The Democratic base remains squarely behind President Barack Obama when it comes to his re-election buthis weakness among independent voters at this point makes his 2012 election prospects uncertain\" said PeterA. Brown assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.\"The demographic splits in the electorate when voters are asked whether the president deserves a second term isa roadmap for his re-election strategists on how they need to focus their appeal. Only 39 percent of men 34percent of whites 35 percent of political independents and 38 percent of those over age 35 think he deservesfour more years in the Oval Office.\"In trial heats for 2012 former Massachusetts Gov.

Daniels is essentially ageneric Republican because of his anonymity to most voters. Obama only gets 45 percent against him while hegets 48 percent against Ms. Palin\" said Brown. \"She is very unpopular among independents and although sherecently said she thought she could defeat Obama the data does not now necessarily support that assertion.\"\"Unlike Daniels who is a political unknown to most Americans virtually all voters have formed an opinionabout Palin and that opinion is not encouraging for her candidacy.\"Ms. Palin is viewed the most negatively by the American people of the possible Republican candidates in 2012.She is viewed unfavorable by 51 percent of voters and favorably by 36 percent. Among independents the keyswing voting bloc she has a negative 54 - 33 percent favorability rating.Huckabee gets a 41 - 25 percent favorability rating and Romney gets a 38 - 26 percent score.

Tim Pawlenty at 6percent and Daniels Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota at 2 percent each.\"The best thing Obama has going for him when it comes to his re-election may be that at this point theRepublicans don't have a candidate who is both nationally well-known and well- liked by a majority of voters\"said Brown.From November 8 - 15 Quinnipiac University surveyed 2424 registered voters nationwide live by telephonewith a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points.The Quinnipiac University Poll directed by Douglas Schwartz Ph.D. conducts public opinion surveys inPennsylvania New York New Jersey Connecticut Florida Ohio and the nation as a public service and forresearch.

The answer of course is nobecause this is riot about geography. Two veteran intelligence operatives with much Middle Eastern and Afghanexperience speaking not for attribution agreed a stable secure Afghanistan doesn't change the equation at leastnot significantly.The popular perception of al-Qaida in Afghanistan is the same propaganda news clip shown a gazillion timesover the last eight years replete with terrorist \"trainees\" in shalwar-kameez (knee-length shirts over baggypantaloons) running through obstacle courses and emerging from tunnels presumably to kill us all in our beds.Al-Qaida doesn't need commando-steeled volunteers to attack the United States and its allies. For the next Sept.11 the chances are they have already selected highly motivated brainwashed wackjobs among the graduates ofPakistan's madrassas who look forward to a one button push to the land of plenty in the sky where 72 impatientmaidens await their arrival. Al-Qaida's \"martyrs\" don't need Afghan training camps for WMD terrorism. In factto be inconspicuous they should not have the physique of an avoid-at-all-cost likely to arouse suspicion.Al-Qaida does not need Afghanistan for its next terrorist objective. In fact those who follow events inAfghanistan closely were taken aback when Obama said Afghanistan was a war of necessity because that'swhere al-Qaida. is. They haven't been there since Afghanistan was liberated in October 2001. They moved toPakistan's tribal areas where they attracted volunteers from the Middle East and Europe. When a reconstitutedTaliban insurgent force re-entered Afghanistan in large numbers in 2004 al-Qaida was not interested in its nowinsecure old training camps. Even if Pakistan's current offensive.against the Taliban and al-Qaida in the tribalareas is successful al-Qaida is not an entity that can be captured or destroyed. Its clandestine operatives arewidely scattered in the Middle East Africa Europe North and South America.As alternatives to Afghanistan and Pakistan Yemen in the vernacular of the intelligence community will do/isdoing it. Somalia will do/is doing it. West African states whose writ doesn't extend much beyond their capitalswill do/are doing it. Grimy North African suburbs of major French cities will do/are doing it. British provincialtowns with Pakistani enclaves will do/are doing it. And the Internet's thousands of pro-al-Qaida Web sites willdo/are doing it.Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be comfortably installed in a tribal chiefscompound somewhere near Quetta the capital of Pakistan's constantly rebellious Baluchistan province whichhas 48 percent of the country's land with. only 10 million of its 175 million people. There is no al-Qaida centralissuing orders to thousands of adherents the world over.If the:re is no connection between Afghanistan and the core problem of \"no more Sept. lls\" what are the UnitedStates and 41 friendly nations doing there? Even in the event of a Taliban victory in the years to come theTaliban would not be stupid enough to invite al-Qaida back. Three months prior to Sept. 11 2001 there waspalpable tension between Taliban leader Mullah Omar and bin Laden. Omar complained that bin Laden wasissuing \"too many fatwas (religious edicts) which he has no business doing as he didn't complete his religiouseducation.\" Omar also prevented journalists from seeing bin Laden. The Taliban leader knows he lost powerand his country because of what bin Laden and his terrorists did to the United States.In today's Afghanistan almost everything turns out to be corruption and mismanagement. The average citizenhas seen little benefit from expenditures in the $250 billion range -- on top of $1 trillion in Iraq. The .U.S. efforthas been plagued by fraud laced with mismanagement and bereft of strategic focus. One example among manyothers came in 2007 when the United States awarded a massive contract worth some $300 million to A:EY aFlorida-based company to supply the Afghan army with 52 types of ammo chiefly bullets for AK-47s. Allrequirements for safety inspections mandatory for all ammo delivered to U.S. forces were removed. Thus AEYwas able to shop around in Eastern Europe for the cheapest ammo available. Millions of rounds of old Chineseammo made in the 1960s turned out to be substandard. and dangerous.The State Department was aware of what was going on but did not object as speed was the only criterion. AEYand its officers were eventually indicted in Florida. But U.S. officials involved got off with a slap on the wrist.Wherever U.S. inspectors look they find fraud and abuse. There are even cases -- reported by GlobalPostreporter Jean Mackenzie -- of American contractors paying bribes to the Taliban to ensure aid projects are notdisrupted. This is a recipe for a war without end. She also reports a disguised Taliban office in Kabul thatreviews all aid projects and determines the amount to be paid to the Taliban.If true the United States is paying the Afghan government to fight the Taliban while also paying the Taliban tofight the Afghan government.The key lies in Pakistan. Almost all terrorist trails in Europe lead back to Pakistan -- and its madrassas. Theseare the free Koranic schools that have stepped into the vacuum of no education system for the poor as themilitary takes up 50 percent of government revenue. A fraction of what the United States has spent in Iraq andAfghanistan would go a long way to turning Pakistan around. Instead Congress in its infinite wisdom afterauthorizing $1.2 trillion in both wars allocated $7.5 billion to Pakistan over five years -- with umpteen caveats.In a country of 175 million a drop in the proverbial bucket.I don't have call sheets for Lobo or Equadoran.

SidFYI:SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED January 22 2010NOTE FOR THE SECRETARYFROM: G/TIP Ã¢ÂÂ Luis CdeBacaSUBJECT: Child Trafficking in HaitiG/TIP is gravely concerned about the potential for human trafficking (TIP) in the wake ofthe earthquake both as a result of the displacement of the population and the influx of troopsand aid workers. Even before the earthquake there were in Haiti up to 300000 restaveks(children given away or sold by their parents and enslaved as domestic servants) as well asreports that members of MINUSTAH used trafficked women in prostitution. In the 2009 TIPReport Haiti was classified as a Special Case country with governance so dysfunctional it couldnot be ranked.The initial disaster response is focusing on immediate needs of food shelter and medicalcare but has thus far not addressed TIP prevention and protection issues. While attention isbeing paid to the problems of orphans and adoptees TIP was not adequately addressed in theUN's initial flash appeal so it is unclear which agency in the international system has the leadon the ground. UNICEF has the child protection lead UNFPA leads prevention of sexual andgender-based violence and IOM is tasked with shelter and camp management. We will work toremedy in a subsequent appeal the omission of TIP from the operational plan.We are moving to redirect $1 million of program funds that G/TIP has on Hispaniola and toreprogram an additional $550000; we will work with PRM to identify other fundingpossibilities. Working through existing grantees and other experienced NG0s it is ourintention to help resuscitate police child protection brigades that already exist in Haiti torebuild capacity of Haitian organizations that protect restaveks to prevent traffickers in theDominican Republic from enslaving displaced Haitians on farms and in prostitution and toeducate Haitian parents of the risks of giving their children away in this time of crisis. We willconsult with partner agencies to ensure that the U.S. presence does not contribute totrafficking. It will be important for the Department's messaging to convey our commitment tofighting human trafficking in both the immediate and long term.SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIEDfyiYes I can do at 10:30.That's gratifying.

He appears laid-back. After claiming that the only way to deal with the PalestinianAuthority was a large-scale attack Netanyahu was asked by one of the participants whether or not the United Stateswould let such an attack come to fruition.\"I know what America is\" Netanyahu replied. \"America is'a thing you can move very easily move it in the right direction.They won't get in their way.\" He then called former president Bill Clinton \"radically pro-Palestinian\" and went on to belittlethe Oslo peace accords as vulnerable to manipulation. Since the accords state that Israel would be allowed to hang on topre-defined military zones in the West Bank Netanyahu told his hosts that he could torpedo the accords by defining vastswaths of land as just that.\"They asked me before the election if rd honor [the Oslo accords]\" Netanyahu said. \"I said I would but ... I'm going tointerpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this gallOping forward to the '67 borders. How didwe do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones aresecurity zones; as far as I'mconcerned the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue.\"Smiling Netanyahu then recalled how he forced former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to agree to let Israelalone determine which parts of the West Bank were to be defined as military zones. \"They didn't want to give me thatletter\" Netanyahu said \"so I didn't give them the Hebron agreement [the agreement giving Hebron back to thePalestinians]. I cut the cabinet meeting short and said 'I'm not signing.' Only when the letter came during that meeting tome and to Arafat did I ratify the Hebron agreement. Why is this important? Because from that moment on I de facto putan end to the Oslo accords.\"President Obama and anyone else concerned about Israel's commitment to the peace process may watch the tapeonline here PI.Related: Tricky Bibi l2) [Haaretz]Article printed from Tablet Magazine: http://wwwtabletmag.comURL to article: http://wwvv.tabletmag.com/scro11/39692/fibi-netanyahu/URLs in this post:[1] said: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/world/middleeast/09mideast.html[2] According: http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/tricky-bibi-1.302053[3] here: http:/ews.nana10.co.il/Articie/?Articield=731025&sid=126Click here to print.Copyright ÃÂ© 2010 Tablet Magazine.

SidH: Is this account true? If so significant and the only account of its kind. And if true the USG has not told its story at theleast. SidXr --rHow do I know China wrecked the Copenhagendeal? I was in the roomAs recriminations fly post-Copenhagen one writer offers a fly-on-the-wall account of how talks faded00 Mark cvnaso c...quk Tuesday 22 December 2009 19.54 GMTCopenhagen was a disaster. That much is agreed. But the truth about what actually happened is in danger of being lostamid the spin and inevitable mutual recriminations. The truth is this: Chrs.a wrecked the talks intentionally humiliatedBarack Obama and insisted on an awful \"dear so western leaders would walk away carrying the blame. How do I knowthis? Because I was in the room and saw it happen.China's strategy was simple: block the open negotiations for two weeks and then ensure that the closed-door deal madeIt look as if the west had failed the world's poor once again. And sure enough the aid agencies civil society movementsand environmental groups all took the bait. The failure was \"the inevitable result of rich countries refusing adequately andfairly to shoulder their overwhelming responsibility\" said Christian Aid. \"Rich countries have bullied developing nations\"fumed Friends of the Earth International.All very predictable but the complete opposite of the truth. Even George IVIonbiot writing in yesterday's Guardian madethe mistake of singly blaming Obama. But I saw Obama fighting desperately to salvage a deal and the Chinese delegatesaying \"no\" over and over again. Monbiot even approvingly quoted the Sudanese delegate Lumumba Di-Aping whodenounced the Copenhagen accord as \"a suicide pact an incineration pact in order to maintain the economic dominanceof a few countries\".Sudan behaves at the talks as a puppet of China; one of a number of countries that relieves the Chinese delegation ofhaving to fight its battles in open sessions. It was a perfect stitch-up. China gutted the deal behind the scenes and thenleft its proxies to savage it in public.Here's what actually went on late last Friday night as heads of state from two dozen countries met behind closed doors.Obama was at the table for several hours sitting between Gordon Brown and the Ethiopian prime minister Males Zenawi.The Danish prime minister chaired and on his right sat Ban Ki-moon secretary-general of the UN. Probably only about 50or 60 people including the heads of state were in the room. I was attached to one of the delegations whose head ofstate was also present for most of the time.What I saw was profoundly shocking. The Chinese premier Wen Jinbao did not deign to attend the meetings personallyinstead sending a second-tier official in the country's foreign ministry to sit opposite Obama himself. The diplomatic snubwas obvious and brutal as was the practical implication: several times during the session the world's most powerfulheads of state were forced to wait around as the Chinese delegate went off to make telephone calls to his \"superiors\".Shifting the blameTo those who would blame Obama and rich countries in general know this: it was China's representative who insistedthat industrialised country targets previously agreed as an 80% cut by 2050 be taken out of the deal. \"Why can't we evenmention our own targets?\" demanded a furious Angela Merkel. Australia's prime minister Kevin Rudd was annoyedenough to bang his microphone. Brazil's representative too pointed out the illogicality of China's position. Why should richcountries not announce even this unilateral cut? The Chinese delegate said no and I watched aghast as Merkel threwup her hands in despair and conceded the point. Now we know why Ã¢ÂÂ because China bet correctly that Obama wouldget the blame for the Copenhagen accord's lack of ambition.China backed at times by India then proceeded to take out all the numbers that mattered. A 2020 peaking year in globalemissions essential to restrain temperatures to 2C was removed and replaced by woolly language suggesting thatemissions should peak \"as soon as possible\". The long-term target of global 50% cuts by 2050 was also excised. No oneelse perhaps with the exceptions of India and Saudi Arabia wanted this to happen. I am certain that had the Chinese notbeen in the room we would have left Copenhagen with a deal that had environmentalists popping champagne corkspopping in every corner of the world.Strong positionSo how did China manage to pull off this coup? First it was in an extremely strong negotiating position. China didn't needa deal. As one developing country foreign minister said to me: \"The Athenians had nothing to offer to the Spartans.\" Onthe other hand western leaders in particular Ã¢ÂÂ but also presidents Lula of Brazil Zuma of South Africa Calderon ofMexico and many others Ã¢ÂÂ were desperate for a positive outcome. Obama needed a strong deal perhaps more thananyone. The US had confirmed the offer of $100bn to developing countries for adaptation put serious cuts on the table forthe first time (17% below 2005 levels by 2020) and was obviously prepared to up its offer.Above all Obama needed to be able to demonstrate to the Senate that he could deliver China in any global climateregulation framework so conservative senators could not argue that US carbon cuts would further advantage Chineseindustry. With midterm elections looming Obama and his staff also knew that Copenhagen would be probably their onlyopportunity to go to cjinT3t?j..chanQE-3. talks with a strong mandate. This further strengthened China's negotiating hand asdid the complete lack of civil society political pressure on either China or India. Campaign groups never blame developingcountries for failure; this is an iron rule that is never broken. The Indians in particular. have become past masters at ca-opting the language of equity (\"equal rights to the atmosphere\") in the service of planetary suicide Ã¢ÂÂ and leftishcampaigners and commentators are hoist with their own petard.With the deal gutted the heads of state session concluded with a final battle as the Chinese delegate insisted onremoving the 1.5C target so beloved of the small island states and low-lying nations who have most to lose from risingseas. President Nasheed of the Maldives supported by Brown fought valiantly to save this crucial number. \"How can youask my country to go extinct?\" demanded Nasheed. The Chinese delegate feigned great offence Ã¢ÂÂ and the numberstayed but surrounded by language which makes it all but meaningless. The deed was done.China's gameAll this raises the question: what is China's game? Why did China in the words of a UK-based analyst who also spenthours in heads of state meetings \"not only reject targets for itself but also refuse to allow any other country to take onbinding targets?\" The analyst who has attended climate conferences for more than 15 years concludes that China wantsto weaken the climate regulation regime now \"in order to avoid the risk that it might be called on to be more ambitious in afew years' time\".This does not mean China is not serious about global warming. It is strong in both the wind and solar industries. ButChina's growth and growing global political and economic dominance is based largely on cheap coal. China knows it isbecoming an uncontested superpower; indeed its newfound muscular confidence was on striking display in Copenhagen.Its coal-based economy doubles every decade and its power increases commensurately. Its leadership will not alter thismagic formula unless they absolutely have to.Copenhagen was much worse than just another bad deal because it illustrated a profound shift in global geopolitics. Thisis fast becoming China's century yet its leadership has displayed that multilateral environmental governance is not onlynot a priority but is viewed as a hindrance to the new superpower's freedom of action. I left Copenhagen moredespondent than I have felt in a long time. After all the hope and all the hype the mobilisation of thousands a wave ofoptimism crashed against the rock of global power politics fell back and drained away.[Go]Pls be sure Bill and I do a letter to for his marriage in June. B6And pls put the following on my call list:Alston JohnsonFrancis CollinsDerek Harvey (he came into see me in the Senate) Paul Charron Lisa Caputo Marty EdelmanAttached and enclosed below is the demarche and letter that went out reflecting your comments.SUBJECT: DEMARCHE/LETTER PRIOR TO AUGUST 28 UNASUR SUMMITREF: A. STATE 86734B. STATE 825811.(SBU) This is an action request see paras 4 - 6.2.(SBU) On August 14 the USG and Colombian governmentprovisionally agreed ad referendum to the text of abilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) (septel).We expect the final agreement may be signed in Bogota inabout a month following a final review by both sides. Asnoted in reftels the DCA would permit the United Statesaccess to several Colombian military bases and facilitateeffective bilateral cooperation on security matters inColombia. It would notot authorize establishment of anyU.S. bases or ports nor would it result in an overallincrease in the number of U.S. military personnel orU.S.-citizen civilian contractors in Colombia.3.(SBU) On August 18 the Secretary and Colombian FMJaime Bermudez met in Washington to discuss the DCAincluding the importance of coordinating our publicaffairs and diplomatic strategies (septel to follow).There is some concern that the upcoming Union of SouthAmerican Nations (UNASUR) summit would become a regionalreferendum on the DCA. Colombian President Alvaro Uribewill attend the summit provided that a full range ofregional security matters can be discussed not just theDCA. In this context we are reaching out to selectedUNASUR members to ask that they raise other regionalsecurity issues beyond the DCA.4. (SBU) Action requested for Santiago Asuncion andLima: that you find an opportunity prior to the August 28summit to raise the importance of discussing the fullrange of regional security topics during the summit andnot merely the DCA with appropriate high levels of hostgovernment.2655. (SBU) Action requested for all: that Ambassadors toUNASUR member states deliver the attached letter from theSecretary to host governments in advance of the August 28summit.6. (U) Begin text:Dear Madam/Mr. Minister:I wanted to take a moment to write to you and yourcolleagues about the upcoming summit of the Union of SouthAmerican Nations (UNASUR) scheduled for August 28 inBariloche. UNASUR provides an important forum to addressthe issues and challenges that affect the region. TheUnited States supports the formation and effectivefunctioning of regional groups such as UNASUR. Theypromote stability cohesion and leadership on key issuesand ensure the best possible communication betweennations.As you know our common neighborColombia has faced an ongoing threat from an unholyalliance of terrorist groups funded by the insidiousillegal narcotics trade. These terrorists have threatenedthe security of average Colombians and sought to overthrowby violence and corruption successivedemocratically-elected Colombian governments. The actionsof these groups also threaten the security of othercountries in the hemisphere sometimes directly in manyways indirectly. Over the last decade Colombians havebeat back this threat to the benefit of us all. Mycountry is proud of the role we have been able to play inthis effort.This battle is far from won. Our governments and peopleare collectively forced to find ways to protect ourselvesand our institutions from such threats. I am certainthese very issues will be addressed at the upcomingsummit including the recently concluded DefenseCooperation Agreement (DCA). We understand thesensitivities associated with U.S. military activities inthe hemisphere and the questions your government may haveregarding the scope and extent of this agreement. I hopethe efforts made in the last few weeks by both mygovernment and the Colombian government have helpedaddress those questions.I would like to take this opportunity to make several keypoints about the DCA. First this agreement is abilateral agreement with Colombia to deepen ourcooperation on security challenges within Colombiapermitting U.S. access to specified agreed Colombian26fifacilities to undertake mutually agreed activities onColombian territory. It is a bilateral agreement thatdoes not pose any threat or risk for the citizens of othernations. On the contrary our mutual efforts to combatdrug trafficking benefit the security of the region as awhole. The agreement does not permit the establishment ofU.S. bases in Colombia. It will not result in an increasein the U.S. military presence in Colombia and we do notseek any such increase. Activities undertaken at or fromColombian bases by U.S. persons will be coordinated inadvance by Colombian authorities. All activities will bebased on full respect for the principles of sovereigntyterritorial integrity of states andnon-interventionism.We are committed to being as forthcoming as possible inaddressing concerns about this bilateral agreement withnations in the region and we have endeavored to do so inrecent weeks through a variety of mechanisms. As concernsor questions arise I hope that you will feel free toreach out to us to seek clarification.The UNASUR summit provides a unique opportunity for theorganization to address a range of security issues thataffect the hemisphere and I salute your leadership fordeciding to discuss these matters. The securitychallenges affecting our hemisphere and your nations inparticular are pressing and grave. Our firm belief isthat a collective and collaborative approach to thesematters is essential. It is our commitment to work withUNASUR nations to help address these concerns.Sincerely yoursHillary Rodham ClintonEnd text.Per my prior email Ã¢ÂÂ read traffic downReines Philippe I <reinesp@state.gov>Thursday December 17 2009 5:39 AMHAbedin HumaValmoroPls print.Abedin Huma <AbedinH@state.gov>Saturday May 02 2009 11:38 AMH2SteinbergI want to see and thank the entire SRAP team on Friday on the 8th floor.H <hrod17@clintonemail.com>Saturday August 12009 11:55 AM'David_Garten@lautenberg.senate.gov'Re: Small WorldDavid--Great hearing from and delighted you got to meetexperience.

But I do think it'swrong.When we were in Government we believed we could only succeed if we treatedNorthern Ireland as a bi-partisan issue and I encouraged other Governmentsto adopt the same approach. That meant when President Bush was in the WhiteHouse I went out of my way always to see and brief Democrats - in Congressand in the Senate - whenever I came to the States. It also meant when weheld the first economic conference led by Mayor Bloomberg in Belfast thedinner we gave at Hillsborough was not restricted to just those inrespective Governments.In respect of how we handled the issue within the UK that didn't mean Iinvited the Shadow Secretary of State to share every platform but theShadow was not excluded from being at major events. Indeed we made a pointof not only saying we were bi-partisan but acted accordingly.Having brokered the Hillsborough Agreement and having discussed with yourSecretary of State - at all stages - how the US could help through anEconomic Conference I am obviously somewhat disappointed not to have beeninvited to attend the Conference in any capacity.That of course should never be confused with my deep respect and adMirationfor Secretary Clinton. Frankly without her help during her time in the WhiteHouse as a Senator as a candidate and now as Secretary we could neverhave made the progress we did. You will know that at the time I was alwaysdisappointed that her contribution to the peace process and politicalprocess was not recognized appropriately by the Conservative Party and theirspokesmen when they were in Opposition.The decision by Owen Patterson to decide not to be present at next week'sConference is a matter for him and the political demands he has chosen onwhich to determine his priorities.

Below is some brief information on the proposal which was made by Saudi Arabia:The proposal made by the then crown prince (now king) in Feb. 2005 called for the establishment of an internationalcounterterrorism center \"under the auspices of the UN.\" The purpose of the organization would be to among otherthings \"develop a mechanism for exchanging information and expertise between States\" on a wide range of non-military counterterrorism issues encourage the establishment of national and regional centers and provide assistanceto developing countries to deal with crises and terrorist acts. The center as conceived in 2005 would also allow nationalcounterterrorism coordinators from different countries and regions to meet and share information and experiences.This proposal was endorsed by the OIC (and OIC countries reaffirm their support for the center each year at the UNGA)but has never received any serious consideration within the UN by non-OIC members. The Saudis continue to beinterested in implementing the proposal. Most significantly recently there have been discussions between the UN andSaudis as to how their proposal could be married with efforts to enhance the UN's capacity to support implementationof the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by allowing the UN Counter-Terrorism Task Force (CTITF) Office and thedifferent CTITF member entities to engage more actively and directly with CT experts/practitioners in capitals and havemultilateral CT consultations wherever necessary.But S/CT mentioned that if we were to move forwardon S/CT's CFO idea we would hope to work closely with the Saudis.Please let me know if you would like any further info.ThanksMikeMichael H.

Forty-one percent now say they disapprove of Mr. Obama's performance as president.In last month's CBS News poll 50 percent of Americans approved of how the president was handling his job while thirty-nine percent disapproved.Analysis: The Irony Behind Obama's Poll NumbersMr. Obama still receives strong support from Democrats (eight in ten approve of his performance) but his approval ratingamong Republicans is only 13 percent. More importantly Mr. Obama's approval rating among independents has declined10 points in recent months Ã¢ÂÂ and it now stands at just 42 percent.Domestic issues Ã¢ÂÂ and not his response to terrorist threats - appear to be driving the president's approval ratingdownward.Just 41 percent now approve of his handling of the economy which Americans say is the nation's most pressing issue.Forty-seven percent disapprove. The president's marks on handling health care with reforms still under debate inCongress are even lower Ã¢ÂÂ just 36 percent approve while 54 percent disapprove. Both of these approval ratings are thelowest of Mr. Obama's presidency.Meanwhile both parties in Congress receive even lower marks than the president on handling health care. FewAmericans think the reforms in Congress hit the right note on expanding coverage lowering costs and regulating thehealth insurance industry. (Read more on the health care poll results)(CBS)The president receives slightly higher ratings for his handling of the war in Afghanistan and the threat of terrorism than ondomestic issues. Forty-six percent approve of Mr. Obama's handling of Afghanistan and 52 percent approve of how he ishandling the threat of terrorism.While some Republicans have criticized the president and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano's responsesto the attempted Christmas Day terror attack most Americans don't share their opinion.In the poll 57 percent of Americans approve of the way the Obama administration has responded to the attempted attackand 29 percent disapprove. Views are highly partisan Ã¢ÂÂ 75 percent of Democrats approve while just 41 percent ofRepublicans and 55 percent of independents do.More Findings from the Poll:Ã¢ÂÂ¢Fear of another terrorist attack has increased since the attempted attack on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdamon Christmas Day. Now 26 percent think another attack on the United States within the next few months is very likely upfrom 12 percent just before the latest incident. This is the highest percentage that has felt an attack was very likely sinceMarch 2003 just after the U.S. invasion of Iraq.Ã¢ÂÂ¢While most Americans (56 percent) have at least a fair amount of confidence that the government will protect its citizensfrom future attacks just 15 percent are very confident. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks more expressed confidence.Ã¢ÂÂ¢Few Americans Ã¢ÂÂjust 19 percent - think U.S. intelligence agencies are doing all they could to monitor the actions ofsuspected terrorists. Seventy-six think they could be doing more.Ã¢ÂÂ¢Most Americans support conducting full body scans on travelers using a digital x-ray machine a device some airportsare now using. Seventy-four percent agree these machines should be used because they provide a detailed check forhidden weapons and explosives and reduce the need for physical searches. Just 20 percent think these machines shouldnot be used because they would produce an image of a passenger's naked body and are an invasion of privacy.Ã¢ÂÂ¢Over half of Americans think the U.S. should continue to keep the Guantanamo Bay prison open. Thirty-two percentthink it ought to be closed and the prisoners there transferred somewhere else.Ã¢ÂÂ¢The American public continues to volunteer the economy and jobs as the most important problem facing the country (44percent) with health care a distant second (14 percent). In the wake of the attempted terror attack on Christmas Day thepercentage that cites terrorism as the most pressing issue has risen to seven percent from zero percent early last month.Ã¢ÂÂ¢The public's overall assessment of the condition of the national economy remains grim Ã¢ÂÂ 82 percent of Americans saythe economy is in bad shape. Looking ahead 31 percent of Americans think the economy is getting better while 19percent think it is getting worse. Forty-nine percent now say the economy is staying the same.745got tickets to Crete and now can't switch.

Details to follow later. SidJanuary 92010The First Lady her young lover and a scandalthat could hand power to Sinn FeinDavid McKittrick reports on the far-reaching consequences ofIris Robinson's infidelityThe mesmerising saga of the toyboy the Northern Ireland First Minister and his straying wife threatened to engulfBelfast's frail political settlement last night.Following a day closeted with advisers Peter Robinson head of the Northern Ireland government broke his silence toinsist defiantly that he would not step down after a day of turmoil. His move is unlikely to stem the clamour for an inquiryinto an affair which has fused the political and the sexual. First indications are that members of his party the DemocraticUnionists (DUP) are reacting to the disclosures with strong disapproval. The party is highly religious and lays heavyemphasis on Christian family values. It is also currently highly nervous that the revelations could cost it seats in thecoming Westminster election. If the DUP were to fracture as a result of the scandal it could lead the way to Sinn Feinbecoming the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly - allowing it to nominate its own first minister and putting thepeace process in jeopardy.Disclosures in a BBC television programme on the activities of his wife Iris who has exited from public life led to a day-long flurry of political calls for inquiries into the Robinson family.Mr Robinson stands accused of failing to notify the authorities that his wife had been involved in financial transactionswithout declaring an interest. She helped a 19-year-old \"toyboy\" lover to set up a business.Mr Robinson said he had asked for the appointment of a senior counsel \"to ask me any questions he or she wishes toask and to give an opinion as to what I should have disclosed or whether I have breached an obligation\".Insisting he had done nothing wrong Mr Robinson accused the BBC of broadcasting \"smears and innuendo\". Saying thathe did not rule out a defamation action he declared: \"I am being tried in the court of public opinion.\"Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness who is Deputy First Minister said he was shocked at the BBC revelations and is seekingtalks with both Mr Robinson and Gordon Brown. Mr McGuinness was publicly sympathetic when news of the scandalbroke but his veering towards a tougher line is taken as indicating a calculation that Mr Robinson may not survive thestorm.Mr Robinson who has been First Minister for 18 months is regarded as a pivotal figure in the peace process since hewas prepared to follow the Rev Ian Paisley into government with Sinn Fein.But the state of the political settlement has appeared increasingly rocky as Mr Robinson has resisted pressure fromalmost all points of the political compass to complete devolution by accepting a transfer of responsibility for policing fromLondon to Belfast.His reluctance to move on the policing issue was attributed to nervousness about challenges from hardline opponents inthe Westminster general election. Now opponents are speculating that it might instead have at least partly been due to thefamily scandal which has just become public but which he knew of for months.In recent days Mrs Robinson dramatically announced that she was leaving politics. She is currently Westminster MP foreast Belfast a councillor and a member of the Belfast Assembly. Yesterday there were calls for her to depart immediatelyand stop drawing her salaries.These reflected the fact that while her husband might have a faint chance of political survival her behaviour is regardedas inexcusable.She had been a friend of Kirk McCambley's father Billy. Before he died he asked Mrs Robinson to look after his son. TheBBC programme Spotlight revealed that her relationship with Kirk had developed into a sexual one. It said shesuggested to him that he go into a business venture which was partly organised by Castlereagh council where she is analderman.She is said to have obtained ÃÂ£50000 from two property developers to be used to set up the business. She is also said tohave helped approve the McCambley proposal without declaring a financial interest. The council said yesterday it wasinvestigating.The young man was interviewed for the programme. So too was Mrs Robinson's one-time political adviser Selwyn Blacka former Methodist minister who gave the BBC access to 150 text messages allegedly sent to him by Mrs Robinson.Among those calling for a public inquiry yesterday were Jim Allister of Traditional Unionist Voice a hardline critic of MrRobinson. He said the issues in the programme must be addressed \"with utter transparency and candour\".Ulster Unionist leader Sir Reg Empey called for Mrs Robinson's immediate resignation saying: \"It is clear that IrisRobinson's continuing position as an MP Assembly member and councillor is utterly untenable. She should resign all herpositions with immediate effect.\"He added: \"It is also unfortunately the case that the office of the First Minister is embroiled in these matters. My party willstudy the events outlined by the BBC and the very serious allegations that have been made with regards to the conduct ofthe First Minister. Inevitably the appropriate authorities will be required to investigate the allegations made against theFirst Minister.\"* Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward refused to speculate about Mr Robinson's future.But he said: \"It is a responsibility on everyone in the Assembly to understand that the consequences of allowing thepolitical process to slide would undoubtedly have an impact on the broader canvas.\"And that if anybody were to be selfish enough to think this is a moment when that can be allowed to be put in the deepfreeze even some may wish to unpick they would be extremely irresponsible foolish and would be playing very verydangerous games.\"Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Woodward said that the First Minister had to be allowed the opportunityto clear his name.But he went on: \"I'm very conscious of the fact that while all that is happening he is First Minister and the business ofdevolution the business of the Executive must go on.\"I hope he will be able to resume the responsibilities as First Minister to ensure that the work of the Executive continuesand that includes the talks on policing and justice devolution.\" PAInteresting approach towards influencing popular attitudes.

So I am re-working the intro to focus more directly on the intersection ofdiplomacy and development as the basis for the QDDR. I think it's working well. AMS is emphatic about re- doing thediplomacy section along these lines so I hope to get her stuff this afternoon (I will probably need to polish it up).

Deuel has lived in Arlington Heights but her heart has resided in JamalPlace a three-story graystone at 1335 S. California Ave. in the North Lawndale neighborhood ofChicago. As a founder and executive director of Jamal Place Deuel can tell countless stories aboutthe boys ages 11 to 17 who have spent time in the group home and about the army of suburbanitesfrom St. Charles Naperville Lake Zurich and Lisle who have volunteered donated and served on theboard to help those kids. Lots of people in that field have good things to say about Deuel and JamalPlace.But when the new fiscal year begins on July 1 the Illinois Department of Children and FamilyServices will not renew its contract with Jamal Place forcing those kids to go to other facilities.\"To shut us down and deny kids this opportunity is unconscionable\" says Deuel as she takes a deepbreath and dabs at her eyes in an attempt to keep her emotions in check.She and her staff operated last year through a $1041000 contract with DCFS to provide a grouphome for 10 wards of the state. They've carved out a wonderful reputation in 15 years so whathappened?The easy answer is that DCFS put the group home under a new performance-based contractingsystem that determined Jamal Place fell short of benchmarks for keeping kids from running awayrequiring hospitalization or ending up in juvenile detention.\"Taxpayers expect and deserve positive results in the children we serve\" says DCFS spokesmanKendall Marlowe. Jamal Place simply didn't measure up in the areas the state measures.Because Illinois has trimmed the number of wards of the state from a high of 52000 in 1997 to only15500 a much higher percentage of those kids have mental illnesses substance abuse or otherproblems. Since the state measures an agency's performance by days that the kids are physicallypresent in the home Jamal Place with its small population got bad marks when a child washospitalized for a mental-health issue or detained by a judge.\"We did what was clinically advisable for these children and we got dinged for it\" says Brian Barclayassistant executive director of Jamal Place. \"We did what was in kids' best interest.\"There is no consideration given for \"incremental improvements in youth behavior which occur astrusting relationships develop\" Deuel notes. \"I wish they could find a way to measure the individualaspects.\"When compared with similar facilities Jamal Place graded lower Marlowe says adding that it \"isn't ahappy day\" when the state ends an agreement with a facility that has \"good people\" and has done\"good work\" in the past. He says DCFS did renew a contract with Deuel for a different transitionalliving facility that serves an older population.One of Jamal Place's \"unfavorable\" outcomes involves a kid who already had a criminal record whenhe came to the group home at age 14. Now 17 he says he ended up in juvenile court after he made amistake by hanging with the wrong people on the day when he stole a woman's purse.\"I've got a good relationship with the staff and residents. We did things as a family\" says the teenwho now is living with a grandmother. \"I love my grandmother but I'd rather be at Jamal Place. I'mtrying to do everything in my power to get back to Jamal Place.\"Intangibles aren't part of the bureaucratic process. There isn't a place on an evaluation form to givecredit to Deuel and her staff for leading the effort that closed a local \"crack house.\" There's no way tomeasure the improvements in a former resident that led him for the first time to sign \"love\" before hisname on the Mother's Day card he sent Deuel this year. There's no scoresheet for the local gangleader who stopped preying on Jamal kids when he was confronted by Deuel and recognized her asthe woman who gave him a Christmas present a few years earlier. The interview for this story isinterrupted when that man calls Deuel who is helping him find a legitimate job.\"It is enormously frustrating to me that the attachment the boys develop with our staff members is nota 'measurable' outcome\" Deuel says. \"These are our children. Long after DCFS is done with thesekids our door is still open.\"Last weekend many former residents came back to explain how Jamal Place helped them. On June26 Jamal Place will celebrate its 15th anniversary with a picnic and walkathon in Douglas Parkacross the street from the home. Deuel and her staff are hoping DCFS finds a way to give them moretime another year to continue its mission.\"I've always maintained that God won't let us fail\" says Deuel. \"For 15 years that's been the caseand now we've got this challenge.\"Funny you mention it -- nearly everyone who has given comments on the speech has tried their hand at \"improving\" thatparagraph (usually reflecting their own notions of what the endstate should look like) not recognizing that it is sacredlanguage.

Controversy arose over statementby Valenzuela during a restricted meeting with the local press in which he echoes the concerns of Americanbusinessmen in that country regarding \"judicial insecurity\" and the management of the economy. Valenzuela alsoindicated that has been noted \"change\" in the investment climate for US businesses and reminded those present that\"in 1996 there was a great deal of enthusiasm regarding investment\" in Argentina. The Argentine Foreign Ministryresponded in a communiquÃÂ© that the government \"has not received complaints from US business with interests andinvestments in the country.\" Interior Minister Florencia Randazzo lamented that \"some officials revert to old practices\"when there is the expectation of a new period in US foreign policy.\" Argentina's Clarin carries the same story titled\"Official Anger with Obama's Envoy Because He Spoke about Judicial Insecurity\" with the Interior Minister's riposte\"Argentina is living in a period of complete judicial and institutional guarantees\" and the nation \"has left behind theperiod in which an official of another country can tell ours what guarantees should exist to benefit its owninterests.\" INFOBAE.com adds that Minister of Justice Julio Alak described Valenzuela's statements as \"unprecedentedand unjustified.\"YesVery much so.

The fourth is the keyparagraph. Jake I'll call. Jeff 202-343-2905 oA Compact of Free Association replaced the United States administration of Palau islands which the U.S. took in war andsubsequently administered for the United Nations. The Compact which was signed in 1986 and took effect October 11994 includes provisions of various duration. Some are to last at least 50 years including full U.S. military authority --although the power of the U.S. to deny access to Palau and its extensive waters by the military of any other nation is tocontinue in perpetuity.The amounts and types of U.S. budgetary and programmatic assistance to Palau under the Compact are specified for 15years but the Compact requires reviews of its terms and the entire relationship on its 15th 30th and40th anniversaries. The reviews are to consider the operating requirements of the Government of Palau and the islands'development. The Compact also commits the U.S. to acting on the findings and to promoting Palau's long-term economicdevelopment.A Palauan delegation that included Vice President Kerai Mariur Chief Representative for Compact Review JoshuaKoshiba Minister of Health Dr. Stevenson J. Kuartei Palau Community College President Dr. Patrick Tellei Ambassadorto the U.S. Hersey Kyota Representative to the United Nations Stuart Beck and their consultants met in Honolulu on July8-9 in connection with the 15th Anniversary Review with an American delegation that included Department of State Officeof Australia New Zealand and Pacific Islands Affairs Alcy Frelick the head of the US Delegation and representatives ofthe Departments of the Interior and Defense and the Weather and Postal Services.The U.S. delegation made positive statements on a few matters and agreed to discuss some others further. A number ofthe U.S. delegation's statements however evidenced a need for greater study by some U.S. officials of the intent as wellas the letter of the Compact the relationship as a whole Palau's economic situation and fiscal responsibilitycommitments and Palau's contributions to the U.S. and to international harmony -- including sacrifice by Palauans in theU.S. military the UN international peacekeeping force and Palau's strategic location and posture and Palau's positions inthe U.N.Palau is grateful for its partnership with the U.S. and wants to continue in the association as called for by the Compactdeepen the relationship and develop its capacities as a freely associated state. It appreciates the more positiveexpressions of U.S. Secretaries of State Clinton and of the Interior Salazar and congressional leaders of both politicalparties. Palau fully trusts that reflection will result in an approach to the relationship consistent with the Compact and topositions befitting the great nation that is the United States.Recognizing that the questions of the association are relatively small and unique for the Government of the U.S. and thatthe U.S. faces many and extraordinary challenges at this time Palau understands why more deliberation by U.S. officialscan be needed.Because of this because of the confidence that it has in the United States and because it would not be productive toelaborate with others on the conversations at this stage Palau's representatives are confining additional comment toofficial communications.B6FyiPis print.From Mills Cheryl D [mailto:MillsCD@state.gov]Sent: Friday September 21 2012 0404 PMTo: HSubject: FW: Libyans march against Islamist militias in BenghaziOverall the speech is worth reading; if you like I'll have it put in your weekend book. 2 passagesparticularly worth noting.1. \"Across the Atlantic Hilary Clinton has pledged to put women 'front and center' of the American developmentagenda.

Hague told you relevant undercurrent toEU debate. SidFrsOrn The TimesNovember 3 2009I suggest a night at the theatre Mr CameronA sop to the party's Europhobes has left the Conservative leader defending the indefensible. He should beashamedDavid AaronovitchOn Friday morning David Cameron called upon David Miliband to apologise. On Friday evening I went to see a play. Theplay was Our Class by the Polish playwright Tadeusz Slobodzianek.In a series of short \"chapters\" Slobodzianek followed a group of classmates in a small Polish village from 1925 to 2002.Like the village the class was half Catholic and half Jewish. In 1941 as the Germans replaced the Russians as theoccupiers almost all the Jews of the area were murdered in a single day. Slobodzianek shows what led up to themassacre and what happened afterwards. It is unbearable.Though the village is not named in the play it is based on real events that took place at Jedwabne on July 10 1941. AsPoland's Institute of National Memory concluded in 2002 on that day 40-50 Jewish men were forced to parade around thetown singing songs and were then led to a barn on the outskirts where one by one they were killed with knives axesand cleavers and then thrown in a pit. Then 300 or more women and children were led from the town square to the barnand locked inside. Kerosene was poured over the roof and walls and set alight. The screams could be heard from twokilometres away; no one survived.In 2001 it was finally acknowledged what many people had known all along. The murderers hadn't been Germans butlocal Poles as depicted in Our Class. Alexander Kwasniewski then the Polish President apologised to the dead Jewsand their survivors at a ceremony in Jedwabne \"in my own name and in the name of those Poles whose conscience isshattered by that crime\".History matters. Few believe that as much as the Law and Justice party of Michel Kaminski who leads the Tory-backedgroup in the European Parliament. The party's leaders have demanded apologies from the Russians for the massacre of21000 Polish officers at Katyn in 1940 and their references to terrible Polish historical suffering have constituted a bigpart of their political appeal.But despite his historical sensitivity Mr Kaminski the MEP for the Jedwabne area did not support the 2001 apology. Heopposed it vigorously associating himself with the \"Committee to Defend the .Good Name of Jedwabne\". Among itsleading members were the local priest Edward Orlowski who Ã¢ÂÂ asked by journalists whether he would be attending theceremony at which the President apologised Ã¢ÂÂ said: \"These are all lies. it is not my business. Germans are responsibleso why should we apologiSe?\"Mr Kaminski developed a slightly different rationale. As he told an interviewer for a far-right newspaper Our Poland themurders Ã¢ÂÂ which he abhorred Ã¢ÂÂ were the work of a few outcasts and that he would only apologise if someone \"from theJewish side\" apologised for how \"the Jews\" behaved during the Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941. Last month MrKaminski (who had denied giving the interview) confirmed this position. \"If you are asking the Polish nation to apologisefor the crime made in Jedwabne\" he said \"you would require the whole Jewish nation to apologise for what some Jewishcommunists did in Eastern Poland.\"It is this argument that so incenses meÃ¢ÂÂ¢as it would anyone I think who had sat through Our Class. The idea of collectiveJewish Bolshevism was a major anti-Semitic trope before the war; it was a major element of self-justification after it.Mr Kaminski denied the apology denied the need for it equated the massacre to \"Jewish actions\" and allied himself withthose who denied the massacre altogether fulfilling the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet's observation about patterns ofmassacre denial: \"it never happened it happened but was justified they did it to themselves they did it to us.\" MrKaminski's view was described as disgraceful by Mr Miiiband. Having read an enormous amount on Jedwabne in the lastfew weeks I think Mr Miliband is completely right Ã¢ÂÂ it is disgraceful. And as he might well demand of Mr Cameron: \"Ishould apologise?\"But more than that I find myself amazed by how Mr Cameron ever came to be in the position of demanding that a foreignsecretary descended from Polish Jews should apologise for possibly offending the sensibilities of a foreign politician whovehemently opposed there being an apology for the massacre of Polish Jews. I think of all the things that Mr Cameron hasgot right in his leadership of the. Conservatve Party and my mental jaw drops at the sheer wrongness of it.Now Tory columnists bioggers and activists are devoting their time to nitpicking sophistry about the nature of collectiveguilt and to attacking non-existent \"smears\" that they say have been attached to the unlovely person of Mr Kaminski.Why?It is true as embattled Conservatives have argued that many of the grand European coalitions contain people whosehistory is problematic. There are odds and sods in the big conservative grouping the EPP and in the socialist group. Butthese personalities are far outweighed by the parties of the IVIerkels and Sarkozys. The Polish member of the EPP forexample is the ruling free-market non-nationalist conservative party of Donald Tusk Ã¢ÂÂ almost certainly the party that MrCameron would join if he were a Pole. The new Tory grouping the European Conservatives and Reformists by contrastis all about odds and sods whom a continental Cameron would certainly shun bar one organisation Ã¢ÂÂ the BritishConservatives.So why get yourself into a position where you have to explain that the Latvian SS wasn't so bad really and that MrKaminski has an understandable position on collective guilt? And the answer seems to be that Mr Cameron promised hisEurophobes in his leadership campaign back in 2005 that he would leave the \"federalist\" EPP and that the logicaloutcome of this move has been the weird alliance that he now finds himself defending.Was it all necessary? No. Was it in Britain's interests? Absolutely not. is it in the interests of progressive Conservatism?You must be joking. So has this happened because Mr Cameron doesn't really care enough about Europe to thinkthrough the consequences of his own lightly given promises or because he's just as much a Euro-nutter as those sectsthe Hannanites the Cashists and the Redwoodians?This is the kind of advice I loathe but I'll say it anyway.

We're sharing the FT op-ed page tomorrow. Here'smy piece....Thanks again for Friday. Much favorable comment. Good luck at the UNGA.President Barack Obama's announcement of a new system.for protecting America'sallies against Iranian missiles has ignited charges that he is scaling back the one heinherited from George W. Bush as a concession to the Russians.In fact the Obama plan is a big improvement on the Bush one and it is designed tocounter an evolving Iranian threat not to mollify Russian anxieties.Mr Bush's decision to put 10 missile interceptors in Poland and an associated radar inthe Czech Republic was based on a concern that Iran was developing long-range rocketsthat could hit the US. The Bush system would have been less effective against shorter-range Iranian missiles and it would have left much of Europe notably including America'sally Turkey unprotected.Over the last several years the Iranians have shifted their efforts from developing a fewlong-range rockets to deploying large numbers of shorter-range ones that pose animmediate danger to southeastern Europe and the Middle East as well as to US forcesstationed there. Unlike Mr Bush's Mr Obama's plan will quickly field a missile-defencecapability to address an existing threat. It can be upgraded to deal with longer-rangeIranian missiles in the future.The Central Europeans who have reacted to the decision with apprehension or alarmshould recognize that the replacement of a conceptually flawed plan with a more credibleone strengthens the bonds of transatlantic defence.The view from Moscow has been clouded by outright paranoia. Military experts theresuspected that the US rockets in Poland while advertised as defensive could be usedoffensively even pre-emptively against Russia. Laying to rest that far-fetched scenariowas not the prime motivation for Mr Obama's decision nor should it have been. Howeverby removing what has been a gratuitous irritant in bilateral relations the president hasimproved the prospects for US-Russian arms control negotiations now underway inGeneva.Those talks could produce by December a new treaty reducing numbers of strategic -that is intercontinental Ã¢ÂÂ weapons. If ratified by the US Senate (which will not be easygiven the ferocity of the partisan wars in Washington) the US and Russia will be on trackfor further reductions in the future. Mr Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedevwho are due to meet in New York this week have jointly called for the eventual goal ofeliminating nuclear weapons.As they and their successors take steps in that direction they will have to grapple with astark paradox of the nuclear age: mutual deterrence depends on each side beingvulnerable to retaliation from the other. If either side has enough defences to trump theother side's offence the mutuality of deterrence breaks down and one or both sides will beon hair-trigger making war more likely in a crisis.American statesmen pounded this inescapable truth into the heads of their initiallysceptical Soviet counterparts 40 years ago. The result was the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)treaty signed by Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev in 1972. By limiting the defensivecapability of both superpowers the ABM treaty was a necessary companion piece to aseries of treaties setting ceilings on offensive weaponry. Because nuclear weapons wereexpected to with us forever the ABM treaty was meant to last in perpetuity.While the Soviets were converted to the logic of restricting defence Ronald Reaganwas not. The late US president championed the development of a space-basedcomprehensive shield that would make offensive weapons Ã¢ÂÂ and therefore mutualdeterrence Ã¢ÂÂ \"impotent and obsolete.\"Many experts believed Reagan's vision which they derisively nicknamed Star Wars wasan impossible dream. So did his successor George H. W. Bush who treated the programwith benign neglect while negotiating with the Russians in the Strategic Arms ReductionTalks (START) begun by Mr Reagan.The second president Bush reversed his father's policy. He greatly weakened theSTART process pulled the US out of the ABM treaty and sought to revive a nationalmissile defence (NMD) system. His decision to build the interceptor and radar sites inPoland and the Czech Republic was as one of his aides told me at the time in largemeasure about \"pouring concrete for what will eventually be a global NMD.\"Key officials of the Obama administration Ã¢ÂÂ including the president himself who studiedarms control in college Ã¢ÂÂ understand the linkage between reduction of offences andregulation of defences. However they have avoided raising that issue in the context of lastweek's decision. That is partly because they want their plan to be judged on its ownmerits vis-ÃÂ -vis the Iranian threat. But it is because they have more than enough fightswith the Republicans without further energizing the right wing by trying to reinstate theprinciples of the ABM treaty.Yet sooner or later the US administration will have to grasp the nettle of regulatingstrategic defences. Otherwise continued reductions in strategic nuclear offences will beeither impossible or worse dangerous.The author is president of the Brookings Institution.We have remarks for you.

SidAlterNet / By Drew Westen24 COMMENTSWhat Created the Populist Explosion and HowDemocrats Can Avoid the Shrapnel inNovemberTo say that the American people are angry is an understatement. The only question at this point is how to mitigate thedamage when the bomb detonates in November.September 1 2010LIKE THIS ARTICLE ?Join our mailing list:Sign up to stay up to date on the latest headlines via email.ftagiou-b ialEffilgandwa olÃÂ§to PolilitNTo say that the American people are angry is an understatement. The political brain of Americans today reflects a volatilemixture of fear and fury and when you mix those together you get an explosion. The only question at this point is how tomitigate the damage when the bomb detonates in November.The bad news is that it's too late for Democrats to do what would have been both good policy and good politics (and whatthe House actually did do) namely to pass a major jobs bill when it was clear that the private sector couldn't keepAmericans employed. The \"Obama Doctrine\" should have been that Americans who want to work and have the ability tocontribute to our productivity as a nation should have the right to work and that if the private sector can't meet thedemand for jobs we have plenty of roads and bridges to fix new energy sources to develop and manufacture andschools to build and renovate so our kids and workers returning for training can compete in the 21st century globaleconomy. From having spent much of the last four years testing messages on a range of issues from immigration totaxes and deficits I can say with some certainty that nothing John Boehner or Eric Cantor could say could come within 30points of generating the enthusiasm -- particularly among swing voters -- of a message that began \"We don't have ashortage of work ethic in this country we have a shortage of work.\" That message resonates across the politicalspectrum. And it isn't even the strongest message we've tested in the last weeks or months that beats back the toughestdeficit-cutting language the other side can muster.But it's too late for that. The administration opted for an alternative doctrine which Larry Summers enunciated on ThisWeek several months ago: that unemployment is going to remain high for the foreseeable future and eventually comedown -- as if there's nothing we can do about it -- and that they will push here and there for small symbolic measureswhose symbolism tends to escape people who are out of work. It's hard to be excited by symbolism when your childrenare hungry or the bank is repossessing your home -- although you didn't do anything to deserve it -- while the people whodid are once again making out like bandits.Although the situation looks bleak for Democrats in November it ain't over 'til it's over. Republicans are shootingthemselves in the foot all over the country running Tea Party candidates who are so far to the right you can't see MiddleAmerica from their porch. And some endangered Democrats will likely see victory in November from theirs if theyunderstand the public mood and speak to it.What is that public mood? It can be characterized by a single phrase -- populist anger -- and it cuts across partisan lines.On the right it is alloyed with racial anxiety and prejudice. On the left it is alloyed with tremendous disappointment atwhat could have been if we had the kind of bold leadership for which times like these cry out. And among people in thevast political center populist anger is alloyed with anxiety and uncertainty -- about their jobs their homes and theirchildren's future.How to Create a Populist Explosion: A Tragedy in Two ActsSo how did we get here? The story can be told as a tragedy in two acts.Act I: The GOP Sets the Country on a Course of Economic Destruction and the President Calls for Truth andReconciliation without the Truth PartÃ¢ÂÂ¢ A strong economic downturn devolves into a Great Recession as the stock market crashes and major banks fail.By October 2008 upper middle class moderate Republicans in the suburbs are so frightened by what's happeningto their assets that they're willing to give Democrats a chance.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A Republican administration that believes in neither government nor regulation creates a 700 billion bank bailoutwith no accountability. Unlike Republicans who would say \"no\" in a situation like this and let a Great Recessionturn into a Great Depression Democrats do the right thing but they don't make it clear from the start that theseare Bush Bailouts and remind Americans over and over that the cause of all the bankruptcies is the bankruptcyof Republican ideology.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A charismatic young president raises people's hopes and expectations as he uniquely can. Americans arefrightened but they are willing and waiting to hear an alternative narrative to \"government is the problem not thesolution\" and a path back to economic recovery and security.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The White House refuses to tell the American people three stories they desperately need to hear.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The first is why the economy has gone into the ditch and who did it. The president is steadfast in his position thatwe should \"look forward not backward\" even as the GOP is blocking his every initiative to clean up its mess. Asconservative attacks on him and Democrats increase he refuses to indict the Republicans in Congress orPresident Bush for having destroyed our economy and putting one in eight Americans out of work and one in fiveeither behind on their mortgage or in the process of having their homes foreclosed by the same bankers whogambled them away. Why did he need to tell the American people who was responsible for their misery -- and torepeat it again and again? Because otherwise if the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression didn'tsubside within a year and half voters would start to associate it with him and his party. This is Neuroscience 101 -- it's how mental associations are formed. But the president never even uttered George W. Bush's name in hisfirst year in office and the first time he did mention Bush was to appoint him along with former President Clintonto co-lead American relief efforts in Haiti. The president doesn't like putting antagonists in any of his stories but ifforced to he would cite unnamed \"naysayers\" \"Washington politics as usual\" or \"Congress\" which wascounterproductive given that Congress was held by his party. The guiding belief at the White House implicit in thismessaging strategy was that Americans have a good grasp on economics and good memories:Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The second story the American people needed to hear from the president was why deficit spending is essentialwhen the economy is spiraling downward. It's not a hard story to tell even in a sound bite. But one of the besteducators to occupy the Oval Office in decades chose not to educate -- he actually did it once with prodding butnever repeated what was a superb explanation --- nor did he remind voters every time his opponents attackedhim for deficit spending that they had left him with a 1.2 trillion dollar deficit on the day he walked into officebecause of their unpaid-for tax cuts to millionaires and unpaid-for war on Iraq that called on no one to sacrificeexcept our soldiers and their families (and our kids and grandkids who will be paying off this war for generations).A year later with Democrats on the ropes the president started to tell that story. It was the right move butappeared defensive because it hadn't been part of his guiding narrative from the start.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The third story the president needed to offer was an alternative narrative on government. The president and hisparty were about to offer effective government as a solution to multiple problems after 30 years of solid brandingby conservatives since Ronald Reagan about how government is the problem. But the narrative never came.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The White House and Democratic Congress pass what virtually all economists outside the Goldman Sachs-to-Washington pipeline consider a half-stimulus that they predict will likely produce half-results. It fulfilled its promise.But the equally predictable political result was a discrediting of the concept of government intervention tostimulate the economy in the eyes of the public -- enough to scare off Democratic lawmakers from doing whatthey learned about Keynesian economics in intro economics for the indefinite future. Instead of blasting theRepublicans for having hurled the country toward an abyss that would now take drastic measures to avert andwarning the American people that this could easily be the first of two or three trillion-dollar packages that might beneeded to get Americans back to work and to get the gears of the economy grinding again before we could startreturning to the kinds of surpluses Bill Clinton had left the last time a Democrat was in the White House thepresident chose to compromise with a party that was so unpopular when he took office that only 20 percent ofvoters at that point would even admit to a pollster that they considered themselves Republicans -- the lowest pointfor the GOP since the rise of public opinion polling 50 years earlier.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The economy continues its free-fall shedding 700000 jobs a month. Meanwhile Democrats don't take the kind ofdramatic steps necessary to stop the bleeding. Americans are becoming desperate but they remain hopeful thatthis new president will turn things around and that perhaps the jobs provisions of the new \"stimulus\" act will docauterize the wound. Meanwhile the stimulus is being portrayed by Republicans as a mixture of pork and fat andno one is effectively answering the charges creating increasingly negative associations to an act that was neveradequately crafted or sold.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The logical follow-up to a bill designed to pull the economy out of a ditch is to make such a bill unnecessary in thefuture by attacking Wall Street for having thrown us into crisis and passing strong legislation to rein in theexcesses that created the economic meltdown. This would have sealed the American people's loyalty to the newpresident and Congress. (Heading into November this is in fact the most popular piece of legislation theDemocrats have passed but it took them nearly a year and a half to get there and by then neither the presidentnor the Democratic Congress enjoyed the good will of the average American.) Instead the same banks thatreceived bailouts are foreclosing in record rates on the homeowners whose payroll taxes funded the bailouts butdon't seem to get the same kind of attention to their needs from the federal government. Adding insult to injurythe banks double and triple credit card interest rates to as high as 30 percent including on people's existing creditcard debt -- while continuing to receive no-interest loans from the federal government.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Despite talk of accountability no one is fired (except one auto executive) virtually no one is prosecuted or eveninvestigated as far as anyone knows and banks that received bailouts flaunt record bonuses.Act II: An Anemic Economy Meets an Anemic Health Care PlanÃ¢ÂÂ¢ The public has been clamoring for health care reform. Over 40 million people don't have health insurance at alland the 85 percent of voters who do have health care have seen their costs double during the Bush years at thesame time as real income has declined. Effective narratives on health care are widely available that win by a 2:1margin against the toughest Harry-and-Louise anti-reform language from the other side. The opposition knows itas evident in a leaked memo by Republican wordsmith Frank Luntz who warns that this will be an uphill climb foropponents of reform who would do well to accept some major elements of it.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ But instead of using any of the well-tested narratives that were highly effective during the campaign or devisingany new ones of its own the administration decides to try to \"sell\" health care without a narrative. (I wrote aboutthis in detail a year ago and will not repeat that history here except in telegraphic form.) The president refuses tostate where he stands on any of the substantive debates about health reform for a year such as whether weshould have a \"public option\" (a term so ill-conceived it's hard to believe the public supported it anyway; imaginethe support it might have received if it had been called instead \"the one health care plan the health insurancecompanies don't get to control\"). Instead the White House uses phrases such as \"bending the cost curve\" whileconservatives flood the airwaves with evocative phrases such as \"government takeover\" \"a bureaucrat betweenyou and your doctor\" and \"death panels.\"Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Instead of using Big Pharma and the health insurance industry as the villains of the health care story which wouldexplain why we need an overhaul rather than a Band-Aid the White House once again offers a story withoutprotagonists or antagonists and cuts secret deals with both industries that become public.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Over interminable months of trying to get the votes of the same Republicans who fought against Medicare forseniors for 30 years until the program was just too popular to keep attacking it and who are still trying to gut SocialSecurity despite its popularity the public then watches what George Will describes as the \"serial bribery\" ofRepublican and Democratic Senators alike as each gets to take his or her turn as the 60th vote.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ At the 11th hour as a compromise plan is finally going to pass the president nixes the idea of a Medicare-likealternative Americans can choose over a health-insurance industry plan if they so desire despite 60 percent ofeven swing voters wanting it included in the bill.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Instead of being the signature bill that demonstrates both that Democrats can govern effectively and thatgovernment can be a force for good for working and middle class Americans (who have just been told that thebetter plans they've negotiated or been offered for years by their employers are \"Cadillacs\" that are going to betaxed out of existence) the entire process proves to the average American that government can't do anythingright and scares moderate Democrats away from voting for any other bill that would ever put them on the recordsupporting government or spending.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ \"Government\" hits an all-time low in the polls matching the popularity of big corporations CEOs and bailouts.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Populist anger emerges as the primary emotion across the political spectrum and the president's job approvalwith swing voters drops into the high thirties.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Following the conventional wisdom Democrats return to their all-too-familiar defensive crouch and conclude thatwhen in trouble tack right. On health care the president and his Cabinet fan out all over television to \"reassure\"the public on health care that abortion won't be covered (thanks for the reassurance but most of us didn't find thatreassuring) that domestic partners won't be covered and that immigrants won't be covered. None of these issuesneeded to be conceded. (I know this because I tested messages on them and well- messaged progressivepositions on them would have boosted the popularity of the bill with swing voters.)Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The White House starts adopting failed conservative policies and talking points that leave the public utterlyconfused about where the president and by extension his party stands on the central issues of the day. Thepresident talks about cutting deficits and increasing spending in the same breath using the metaphor of familiestightening their belt in tough times which only strengthens resolve against stimulating a faltering economy;pledges support for massively expanding offshore drilling and \"clean coal\" (which doesn't exist by the way) in aspeech on climate change; and sends in 1200 additional National Guards to Arizona as an apparent reward forpassing \"No Latino Left Behind\" while publicly objecting to the legislation.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The underlying psychological assumption of these moves is that if you mix policies from the right and left in equalparts you win the center. In fact no one has ever won the center that way. It appears weak opportunistic andincoherent to the average swing voter which is particularly problematic at a time when people in the centerdesperately want to know that their leaders have a vision and a coherent plan for what to do (which is why bothFDR and Ronald Reagan were so effective in moving voters in the center). It doesn't win any votes on the right.But it does have one predictable effect: It sucks the motivation out of your base who feel demoralized andbetrayed (if they're part of the \"professional left\") or less likely to vote (if they're average voters who don't followpolitics carefully but just don't feel very enthusiastic anymore even if they don't really know why).Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Capping it all off the BP disaster occurs two weeks after the president has adopted the \"drill here drill now\" \"allof the above\" position of the Republican Party and the oil companies. This could have been the perfectopportunity to go on the offensive contrast what Democrats stand for (common sense protection of our safetythe land we leave our children and key American industries and jobs and sticking up for ordinary Americansagainst big businesses and their lobbyists) with what Republicans stand for; and connect the dots between whathappened on Wall Street (with regulators owned and operated by the companies they were supposed to regulate)and what happened in the Gulf (where precisely the same thing happened). Instead the administration finds itselfon the defensive increasingly sounding like a subsidiary of BP allowing BP to call the shots and controlinformation for weeks defending increasingly hard-to-believe statistics and issuing press releases that appearindistinguishable from those issued by BP but are inconsistent with assessments of independent scientists.Where Do We Go from Here?So that is where we find ourselves today: a Democratic Party and Democratic base that is demoralized and unlikely tovote in high numbers in November; a Republican Party that is selling replanted Bushes with tremendous enthusiasm; anda vast political center filled with voters who are utterly confused and unsure who to turn to but certain that things aren'tgoing well.In January 2009 no one could have predicted that Democrats would be in this predicament today. Perhaps Democratsmight lose a few seats lost in an off-year election but certainly no more than that. We had just seen -- and the Americanpublic knew we had just seen -- the most disastrous performance by a president and party in living history and theAmerican people had elected a tremendously charismatic young president with enormous Democratic majorities in bothhouses of Congress. They had given the president and Congress a strong mandate for whatever kind of change wasnecessary to get us out of economic free-fall and to put Americans back to work.But there were red flags already by the end of Obama's first week in office that led me to offer the following advice to thenew administration: Tell the story of how we got in this mess or you'll own it. Tell a coherent story about deficit spending.Re-brand government because there's only one story out there now (Reagan's) and it's not one that supports aprogressive agenda. Never let attacks go unanswered because doing so only emboldens your opposition and leads thepublic to believe that you have no answers to them. And if you throw a bipartisan party and no one comes don't throwanother one. All of what followed has been as predictable as it has been unfortunate. A year and a half later the WhiteHouse hasn't consistently done any of these things although the President is now intermittently doing some of them andwhen he does he does them well.The question today is whether Democrats can channel the populist anger we are seeing around the country this late in thegame. The answer is that we'd better try. Having recently tested messages on economics and jobs including how to talkabout deficits and taxes -- widely assumed to be Democrats' Achilles Heel particularly now -- there is little question that ifDemocrats and progressives from center to left simply say what they believe in ways that are evocative values-drivenand speak to people's worries and 'anger many stand a good chance of surviving November particularly when theiropponents have nothing to say other than warmed-over rhetoric about cutting taxes to millionaires and multinationals andfiscal restraint except where it cuts into profits of their campaign contributors. Even the most evocative boilerplateconservative messages fall flat against honest messages that speak to the need to get Americans working again. And onissue after issue no message is more resonant right now than one that sides with working and middle class Americansand small business owners against special interests big business and their lobbyists.But actions speak louder than words and Americans want to see action. It may be too late for the kind of jobs bill weshould have seen a year and a half ago but it isn't too late for Democrats to go on the offensive against the Republicans -- virtually all of them -- who opposed extending unemployment insurance to millions of Americans who were thrown out ofwork by the Republicans' corporate sponsors. It isn't too late for Democrats to contrast their support for the highly popularaid to state and local governments that just saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers firefighters and policeall over the country with Republicans' desire to throw them out onto the street. It isn't too late to make a voting issue out ofthe bill the Republicans are stalling that would give small businesses a fighting chance in an economy stacked againstthem and to make clear that one party stands for small businesses which create 75 percent of the new jobs in thiscountry and the other party stands for big businesses that outsource American jobs and offshore their profits to avoidpaying their fair share of American taxes. It's not too late to pass a bill that would limit credit card interest rates to areasonable percent above the rate at which credit is made available to credit card companies. It's not too late to pass thefirst badly need \"fix\" to the health care reform act to demonstrate to Americans that Democrats mean it when they say thiswas just the first step namely a law that stops insurance companies from increasing their premiums by 40 percent whilecutting the size of their networks by 50-75 percent which violates the principles of affordability and choice that were soessential to efforts to sell health care reform to the public. It's not too late to vow to change the rules of the Senate toprevent the use of the filibuster to give every special interest veto power over every important piece of legislation. It's nottoo late to introduce legislation that's been on hold in both the House and Senate to guarantee fair elections so that thevoice of everyday Americans is heard over the voice of the special interests that finance political campaigns.On every one of these issues a strong populist message trounces anything the other side can say. But Democrats needto play offense. They need to take up-or-down votes on bill after bill including those they expect the other side to blockknowing that every one of those votes has the leverage of a campaign ad behind it. They need to change the narrativefrom what sounds to the average American like a whiny and impotent one -- \"the Republicans won't let us do it\" -- to anarrative of strength in numbers shared with their constituents. And they need to make every election a choice betweentwo well-articulated approaches to governance -- and to offer their articulation of both sides' positions and values.That leads to a final point. What Democrats have needed to offer the American people is a clear narrative about what andwho led our country to the mess in which we find ourselves today and a clear vision of what and who will lead us out. Thatnarrative would have laid a roadmap for our elected officials and voters alike rather than making each legislative issue aseemingly discrete turn onto a dirt road. That narrative might have included -- and should include today -- some keyelements: that if the economy is tumbling it's the role of leadership and government to stop the free-fall; that if Wall Streetis gambling with our financial security our homes and our jobs true leaders do not sit back helplessly and wax eloquentaboUt the free market they take away the dice; that if the private sector can't create jobs for people who want to workthen we'll put Americans back to work rebuilding our roads bridges and schools; that if Big Oil is preventing us fromcompeting with China's wind and solar energy programs then we'll eliminate the tax breaks that lead to dysfunctionalinvestments in 19th century fuels and have a public-private partnership with companies that will create the clean safefuels of the 21st century and the millions of good American jobs that will follow.That's what Democrats stand for. It's time they said it.Drew Westen Ph.D. is Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at Emory University founder of Westen Strategies andauthor of The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.OkJmPls print two copies.PIR <preinesMonday April 26 2010 9:52 PMRe: Nice picture!Today's to do list read:1) Remove all copies of Post from 7th floor2) Prevent item from appearing in clips3) Avoid HRC at all costs provide no opportunity for ribbingAs you can see I went 0 for 3http://www.brookings.edu/Ã¢ÂÂ/media/Files/rc/reports/2010/08_arab_opinion_poll_telhami/08_arab_opinion_pollielhami.pdfFyiWe traded calls but I haven't heard back.Later--how about 10?

Tories desperately do not want Blair there want to run their ownEuropean policy mostly anti-EU and indeed break with past and continuity on Europe. Tory Party split with anti-EUfaction dominant its base virulent and Cameron straddling as best he can. Hague leans anti-Europe. SLondon TimesOctober 22 2009`Appointing Blair as EU president will haveconsequences' warns HagueWilliam Hague's strident attack on his fellow Briton reportedly left some of the EU ambassadors baffledFrancis Elliott David Charter and Tom BaldwinWilliam Hague has been conducting a behind-the-scenes campaign to convince European ambassadors that Tony Blairwould be a bad choice for European Union president The Times has learnt. The Shadow Foreign Secretary used a lunchorganised by the Swedish presidency in London last week to lobby the most senior diplomats of the 26 other EU nationsagainst the appointment.EU leaders had hoped to choose the new president at next week's summit but the Czech Republic's last-minuteobjections to the Lisbon treaty have scuppered that. President Sarkozy of France wants a quick decision however and isunderstood to be pushing for a special one-day summit in Brussels next month to fill the new post.In making the Conservatives' case against Mr Blair Mr Hague said that while in Downing Street the former Prime Ministerhad consistently placed a higher priority on US interests than on those of Europe. Mr Hague also reminded the diplomatsof Mr Blair's actions in the run-up to the Iraq war according to one of those attending the lunch last Thursday.A claim that Mr Hague told the ambassadors that the Tories would regard Mr Blair's appointment as a \"declaration of war\"by the EU was denied however. A spokesman for Mr Hague said that the phrase was \"a bit strong\". Nevertheless it wasnot disputed that Mr Hague made clear that the move would have consequences for relations between Britain andBrussels. Diplomats said that there was a \"clear mark of hostility\".\"Mr Hague wanted to leave the ambassadors in no doubt that the Conservative Party is opposed to the appointment ofTony Blair as president of the European Council and [that] it would only underline the lack of accountability and legitimacyinvolved in the creation of the position in the first place\" Mr Hague's spokesman said. Mr Hague's strident attack on hisfellow Briton reportedly left some of the ambassadors baffled.Mr Hague is currently in Washington for talks with members of the Obama Administration including Hillary Clinton theSecretary of State with whom he raised the issue of the Conservatives' membership of a right-wing alliance of Europeanparties with allegedly anti-Semitic members. He accused critics of running a smear campaign against some of the groupled by Michal Kaminsky head of Poland's Law and Justice Party.Great interview w/ her on cnn or msnbc where she talked about how impt it is to have a strategic and economicdialogue and how the long term importance is less specific deliverables than increased understanding of why each sidetakes the positions it does prduces good results over time --that we've seen that in the past.

Yahoo! Mail has the best spam protection around=20http://mail.yahoo.com=20Dear, Friend.My proposal to you will be very surprising, as we have not had any Personal contact before. However, I sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction,which I propose to you as a person of transparency,honesty and high caliber. Let me first start by introducing myself properly to you. My name is Ron Sinclear, i was the Personal Assistance to the    (Haitian) President . I apologize if I have infringed on your privacy. It may interest you to know that the former president of (Haiti) has been fighting serious  war for United  Democracy  for quite some years now, which has been backed (all along) by some foreign powerful countries.Not quite long ago, the American government ordered  (President, Jean Bertrand Aristed) to leave  (Haiti) or be forced out of power by a Rabel force.Knowing fully well the capabilities of America and other powerful members of the United Nations, (President Aristed) decided,and left the seat of power  into exile in South Africa country to seek asylum. now a new government is in place . In the light of all these sad happenings, there was this deposit he made with a Security Company in Europe in year May 2001 ,this took place while he was still in power as the president of Haiti, through my aid, his Personal Assistant, (Ron Sinclear) and some loyalist, he suceeded to secretely move the sum of ($9.5M USD) (NINE MILLION,FIVE HUNDERED THOUSAND, UNITED STATES DOLLARS] to a private security company vault in Europe. Now, we need your services as  a highly reliable foreigner to receive the funds into your bank account for the future survival of my family because he (Aristed)  cannot presently operate any foreign bank account in his name. These funds (US$9.5m USD.) arose from various money i received from the sales of diamonds deals, i had with ( President Charles Taylor) of Liberia, which are abound in great quantity around the coastal areas of  liberia.  I have decided that if you are able assist us,you shall be compensated with 25% commission of the funds, 5% of this money shall be set aside to take care of any local or foreign expenses that might be incurred along the line. My family will have the remaining 75% of the funds. It might also interest you to note that all security arrangements regarding this  transaction has been put in place, therefore,you have nothing whatsoever to fear or worry about, as every arrangement will be co-handled by you and my former Personal Assistant (Ron Sinclear) who is now presentely in Europe The Netherlands for possible conclusion of this arrangement.Most part of this share (70%) for my family will also be invested in a lucrative business courtesy of your full advice, assistance and connections because that is the most importat part of this transaction. As you indicate interest to assist my family,please kindly send to us your telephone/fax numbers for further discussion and clarification.I will be expecting to receive your urgent response for us to proceed to more details on .this pending transaction.

I am  MISS maria denise,20years old and the only daughter of my late parents MR.and MRS denise My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2003.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so special.Before his death on Febuary 12 2003 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of Ten Million United State Dollars.(USD$10 000 000) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was decleared as family valuables personal for security reasons. I am just 20years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. Sir,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask you these question:-(1.)

My name is Mr. Jonathan Masin (from Harare, Zimbabwe) and I got your address through the Bloemfontein refuge camp information centre. I am the first son of late Dr Joel Masin, a farmer and business man who died in September 2003 as a result of the land dispute in my country, Zimbabwe. My father used to be a very good friend of Mr. Robert Mugabe until the government introduced the land use decree which enforced the seizure of all white owned farms. Due to my fathers, and other eminent persons opposition to the land use act which was well pronounced all over the world, even up to date, Mr. Mugabe became my fathers worst enemy, he seized his farm and imprisoned him for a long time.After the legal institution of my country found my father not guilty and he was released, Mr. Mugabe used his powers as the president and plotted the assassination of my father in his farm. He was burnt to ashes and his remain were thrown into the bore hole in his farm. We discovered this and wrote several petitions against the government. Knowing that this petition has reached a very heated stage, Mr Mugabe decided to eliminate my entire family. My sister and brother were kidnapped from their school and until today, they have not been found. I ran to South Africa with my sick mother and two other younger ones and came to this refugee camp, where we have been since December 2003. Why I am writing you are that, when my father was alive, he took me to South Africa and we visited a security company where he lodged a consignment which he informed me was loaded with the sum of US$20,500,000 (TWENTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS). This money wasgotten from the sale of several of his farm machinery in combination with that of a few of his white friends whose family could not finally make it out of Zimbabwe (they were all killed secretly).They had to sell off their machinery to avoid seizure and also to ensure that they do not loose all they acquired in life. My request here is to seek your assistance to retrieve this consignment from the security company. As a refugee, I can do nothing about it and to lay claim to it will be a big problem for my family, since Mr. Mugabe is still in power. We have contacted a financial adviser who has agreed to process the necessary legal documents to assist you claim this consignment as your own. The security company does not know the contents as it was deposited by my father as diplomatic valuables.Our intention is to ensure that this money gets into a bank and as refugees we cannot operate bank accounts. We shall offer you 20% of the total amount for all your efforts and there is no single risk what so ever involved. If you are willing and kind enough to assist us, please contact us on above email, fax number. The fax number is a direct one and we use it personally through the financial adviser. I hope seriously that you consider this as ways to assist us get out of the mess we are in. Thank you as i wait foryour urgent reply. RegardsJonathan MasinDear Friend, I am Mrs. Mariam. Abacha, the widow of General Sani Abacha the Late Nigerian Head of State. I am presently in distress and under house arrestwhile my son Mohammed is undergoing trial in Lagos and Abuja though he has just been recently granted bail under the condition that my family refunds to the Federal Government some amount of money. The government has frozen all the family account and auctioned all our properties. Refer to this website about my husband's loot and you will understand what I mean http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1935646.stm To save the family from total bankruptcy I plan to ship through an undercover courier company,the sum of US24, 000,000.00. kept by my late husband.The money was was carefully packed into a Trunk Box and deposited with the Company has Material`s of Inheritance and Jewelries to beat the Nigerian Security.

My name is Dr.Mark Kingsley William, and I work in the International Operation Department in a Bank here in London.I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important business.Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However, this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated as such. At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties. WE WANT TO  TRANSFER OUT MONEY  FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS  A FOREIGNER, a  program leader.Until his death,The Late Prime Minister, Mr. Rafik Hariri,  has a huge investment here in the United Kingdom and all over the world, as a matter of fact he has the sum of( THIRTY TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ) in his account here in London which he deposited as a family valuables.The family do not know about this deposit.I was on a routine inspection that I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of ( THIRTY TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has  passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody will come again for the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder, therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide all necessary information needed in order to claim this money, Hoping in God that you will never let me down now and in future.o.k!Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri (November 1, 1944 - February 14, 2005), married to Nazek Audi Hariri, was a Lebanese self-made billionaire and business tycoon, and was five times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) before his last resignation from office on October 20, 2004.

account is Khalifa T.Ibrahim a foreignerbefore his death,he was a management consultant and he died since 1992.No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that until his sudden death he was a management consultant.Since I hardly know any foreigner,I am only contacting you as a foreigner partner to stand and apply as his next of kin because this money can not be approved to a local person here as his next of kin,without valid international foreign passport,but can only be approved to any

need your strong assurance thatyou will never,never let me down.With my influence and my position in the bank the bank official can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account that you can

My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days.It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.june 2005.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth!     My mother died when I was just 6 years old,and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on 12th june 2005, he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him th at he has the sum of six million,seven hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$6.700,000) deposit security company in Europe.He further told him that hedeposited the money in my name,and finally issued a written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in possession of all the necessary but legal documents to this fund and the security firm.     I am just 19years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what  to do.Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this funds. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis  here in Ivory coast.The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.     Now permit me to ask these few questions:-      1.

He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.  Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $10.6 (Ten Million six hundred thousand U.S.Dollars)with one finance/security company in EUROPE. Presently,this money is still with the Security Company.Recently,my Doctor told me that I have six months to live as I am terminally ill with cancer.Though what disturbs me most is my partial paralysis.Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church/mosque or better still a Christian/Moslem individual that willutilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in.I want a  church/Mosque or individual that will use this to fund churches/Mosque,Orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.They said blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband's relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be mis-used by unbelievers.I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner,hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of God.If you will be of assistance,I will surely appreciate and reward you for your kindness in rendering help to a dying woman.Mrs Susa Wright Jose Cesar.Email:susanceasar@myway.com- susanjose ceasarFROM AUDITORHEAD OF DEPARTMENTBANK OF SCOTLANDUNITED KINGDOM25/2/2005ATTENTION!

Dear Sir,I am MR IAN REED, The Head of Operations Commercial Finance Service. I am writing following an opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us. In my Bank we discovered an abandoned sum of US$8 MILLION in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this website.http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/thom02.shtml http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because the Bank cannot release the funds unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill. We agreed that 20% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while the balance will be for me and my colleagues. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account.

This request may seem strange but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is Col. Victor Aloma of the Democratic Republic of Congo I am one of close aids to the formal president of Congo Democratic LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace.For the military of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebles in my country, I was instructed by him (late president Kabila) to go to the Europe to purchase ARMSAND AMMUNIATION worth us$15.5(fifteen million Five Hundred Thousand us Dollars) to fight the reble groups. But when it became ap! parent  that presidentKabila has been killed in a bloody shoot out by one of his aids. I immediately decided to divert the fund ( US$15.5) into  a private security company for safekeeping. The money is presently in Holland (The Netherlands) where I am currently in exile  after the death of president Kabila.I need a reliable and trust worthy foreign partnerational who can assist me to clear and move this money as the beneficiary from the security company.Though we have not seen nor met each other, but I would want this transaction to be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks, this money in question is state fund as it is a deal between you and I, hence the need for secrecy considering the security implications.Thus, if you are willing to assist me to move this fund out of the Netherlands, you can contact  me onthe above email addres to enable us discuss more about the deal and what  your percentage will be for assisting me.Please note that you will be required to make a brief trip to the Netherlands for inspection of the fund. I also intend to visit your country soonest in order to inquire areas of possible business investment.I shall be sincerely glad if my request is rendered.Kindest  Regards,COL. Victor Alomaalternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to anotherbank with you as account holder, this way there will be no need for you tothink of receiving the money from the firm.We can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of theconsequences of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest inthis project that you should discard this mail. I ask also, that you donot be vindictive or destructive, if my offer is of no appeal to you,delete this message and forget I ever contacted you; please not destroy mycareer because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know thisbut people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situationsrun the whole private banking sector, I am not a criminal and what I do, Ido not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you tounderstand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make thismove.

The said amount was sum of $ TWENTY TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($22.3m)Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the Bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.Our Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank  treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 65% will be for me. Please, you have been adviced to keep \"top secret\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after I conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in.All other necessary vital information will be sent to you when I hear from you.I look forward to receive your email.Yours faithfully,Mr NABA MOHAMMED HOME ADDRESS:288 QUEAZINFERDINAND AVENUE OUAGADOUGOUBURKINA-FASO._________________________________________________________________Ten : profite de ton Messenger en illimitÃ¯Â¿Â½ sur ton mobile !  http://mobile.live.fr/messenger/ten/Kosombo  Chamberlee & Associate.11 Baker Squre Lagos Nigeria.Tel/Fax:234-8035820155.Email address:barr_kok@yahoo.comMy Dear:First,I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this by virtue if its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOPSECRET.Though I know that a  transaction of this magnitude will make  any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I am barrister Kofi Kosombo,solicitor at law.I am the personal attorney to Mr  Paul Hamp , a national of your country,who was in contract with shell development company in Nigeria.On the 21st of April 1999,my client,his wife And their three Children were involved in  a caraccident along sagbama express road.All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives  this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his last name over the Internet, to locate any member of his family  hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in retrieving the sum of US$10m deposited in a security company by my client before it get'sconfisicated because the security company doesn't know that the content of the consignment is cash because on the day of deposite we declared it as family valuables because we never want them to know the true content of the consignment.The security company has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the consignment confisicated within the next two weeks and these very money is too  big for me to allow it to beconfisicated by the authority. Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over 2 years now I seek your consent to  present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last name so that the proceeds of this consignment valued at 10million dollars can be released to you and then you and me can share the money. 60% to me and 40% to you I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back the claim.All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. I am not imposing this transaction on you,It is a thing of self  willing ness,so it is either you write me back and tell me you are willing and I will know the next step to take because this fund must be claimed either with your help  or the help of somebody else. After going through the proposal and under standing it very well and you are willing to do this transaction with me,get back to me immediately so that we can start as follows:1)I will send to you the contact of the security company,the deposite code, for you to call for verification if such deposite is really existing.2)The claim will require both of our physical presentation at the security company. With constant communication it will not take us more than seven working days to achieve our aim.It is a promise that at the end of the day you will embrace me and we will become one family friends for life as I was with my late client.  Your private telephone is also needed in reponse to this proposal for oral discussions and better understanding.While I wait for your reply.Best RegardKoffi Kosombo.<P>Greetings</P><P>I am Mr.Charles Brown, a Canadian citizen and an Attorney based inManchester,England.I am the personal Attorney to late Mr Mark Michelle(aforeigner and a private oil consultant/contractor with the shell petroleu=mDevelopment in Saudi Arabia),hereinafter shall be referred to as my clien=t.</P><P>Unfortunately, my client and his wife lost their lives in a Plane cras=hin Dec,2003.My Several attempts to locate any of his relatives as directe=dby his bank were all to no avail, even I've made enquires with his countr=y'sembassies and so far,non of his relatives have been traced.It may interes=tGreetings from Dubai=2CThis letter must come to you as a big surprise=2C but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners=2E  I am Mr=2E Arif Shaikh=2C currently Chief Credit & Risk Officer with a reputable bank here in U=2E A=2E E=2E  I write you this proposal in good faith=2Cbelieving that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you=2EI have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you=2E On November 6=2C 2000=2C an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant=2Fcontractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION=2C MR MOHAMMADAL NASSER made a =28Fixed deposit=29 for 36 calendar months=2Cvalued at US$17=2C500=2C000=2E00 =28Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only=29 in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently=2E Upon maturity in 2003=2C as his account officer and as well the bank manger=2C it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered=2E After sometime=2C I tried sending back the letter=2C but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers=2C Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr=2E Mohammad Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein =28former Iraqi President=29 during one of his trips to his country Iraq=2C as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans=2E On further investigation=2C I discovered that Mr=2E Al Nasser's family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents=2C including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL=2E  This sum of US$17=2C500=2C000=2E00 have been floating and placed under dormant=2Funserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the owner since 2003=2E  I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far=2C my bank management is not aware of it=2C I am the only one that have the information=2EWith the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U=2E A=2E E=2E  By end of this year=2C the government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above $5=2C000=2C000=2E00 to explain the source of the funds=2Cmaking sure it is not for terrorism support=2E  If I do not move this money out of the country immediately=2C by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money=2C because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the money=2E  I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance=2E  As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser=2Ccoupled with my present position and status in the bank as Chief Credit & Risk Officer =2C I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account=2C with the correct information concerning the account=2C which I shall give you=2E All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved=2C the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law=2C beside U=2E A=2E E is porous and anything goes=2EIf you accept to work with me=2C I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage=2C so that both parties will be satisfied=2E  If you are interested=2C contact me as soon as you receive this message  so we can go over the details=2E  Thanking you in advance and may God bless you=2E Please=2C treat with utmost confidentiality=2E  I shall send you copy of thedeposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal=2E   I wait your urgent response=2E   Regards=2C Mr=2E Arif ShaikhDEAR SIR, STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL I AM MIKE CHUKWU , THE MANAGER, BILLS AND EXCHANGE AT THE FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPARTMENT OF THE ZENITH INTERNATIONAL BANK PLC.

(Principal Attorney).Mr Lewis MusasikeDevelopment Bank of Southern Africa.1258 Lever RoadHeadway Hill,MIDRANDRepublic Of South Africa.Email:lmusasike@dearriba.comHello,I am Mr Lewis Musasike, General Manager(Treasury) of Development Bank of Southern Africa.This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition.On May 27, 2001,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Mr.Kelvin Smith made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$10,500,000.00, (Ten Million, five hundred thousand Dollars).Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.Kelvin Smith died from an automobile accident.On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Kelvin Smith did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$10,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping.No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to South African Law,at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account.I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds.The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney.If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.Awaiting your urgent reply via my email Above.Thanks and my regards.Lewis Musasike.------------------------------------------------------------------------------deArriba me paga por navegar.

Prior to their death, this white couple had lived in this country since the 1960?s as missionaries and educationists. Unfortunately, they died childless, with no knownrelatives or next of kin.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>The issue at stake, for which I am writing you now, is that the deceased left behind the sum of US$7.8million in their joint account with ECO INTERNATIONAL BANK Nigeria Incorporated.<BR>Soon after the burial of the deceased, I had promptly notified the bank,which is awaiting me to present to them the person that is to inherit the account of the deceased.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Incidentally, as I said before, the late couple had no known next of kin or relatives. No one else knows about this.However, it will amount to abuse of privilege for me to lay claim to the wealth and estate of the deceased, since as a black man i couldn't have been their relative. But then funds can't be left to the bank permanently/forever. So I have decided to contact you, to seek your consent to present your name to the bank as the next of kin and the appointed administrator/inheritor of the estates of the deceased.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;As a whiteman, you'll fit into the picture.As the lawyer to the deceased, no body can disbelieve me if i present you as the next of kin to the deceased. Moreover, I know the exact legal requirements and documents to secure in your favour to show proof that you are actually the next of kin/inheritor of everything left behind by the deceased. All these will be my responsibility to obtain from the court here in Nigeria. You won?t be needed here in person.</DIV><DIV>I can assure you that this is my specialty and there is nothing for you to be afraid of. I will handle and provide for all that it will take legally.Once everything needful is done, the bank will be satisfied to transfer the monies from the account of the deceased to yours.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>My interest is to take 60% of the funds while you take 30%, while the remaining 10% will be disbursed to any Orphanage-Home of our common choice.Please communicate your decision to me urgently, indicating your Telephone number in your reply so that I can call you and talk this thing over with you.</DIV><DIV>Pls. keep these disclosures confidential.<BR>Thank you.<BR></DIV><DIV>Sincerely yours,<BR>Barrister PATRICK AGOLO(ESQ)</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV><p>\t\t<hr size=1>Do you Yahoo!?<br> Read only the mail you want - <a href=\"http://us.rd.yahoo.com/mail_us/taglines/spamguard/*http://promotions.yahoo.comew_mail/static/protection.html\">Yahoo!

We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3years and 10months  the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.  Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr. Wang  Qin___________________________________________________________________________http://snura.netDEAR FRIEND,I MAKE THIS APPEAL WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY FACTS OR OPINION EXPRESSED BY ME ARE GIVING IN CONAFIDENCE AND SOLELY FOR YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND USE.I AM DR.IBRAHIM KAF ,THE MANAGER OF BILL AND EXCHANGE AT THE FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPARTMENT OF MY BANK.BEFORE I WROTE YOU,I PRAYED THAT YOU WILL BE A HONEST AND RELIABLE PERSON WHOM I CAN WORK WITH TO ACHIEVE THIS DEAL OF OUR LIFE.FROM MY SECTION IN THE BANK, I DISCOVERED AN ABANDONED SUM OF SIX MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($6.8M) WITH ACCOUNT NUMBER 14-2558-5976 THAT BELONGS TO ONE OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WHO DIED ALONG WITH HIS WIFE AND ONLY DAUGHTER IN A PLANE CRASH OF ALASKA AIRLINES FLIGHT NUMBER 261 WHICH CRASHED ON MONDAY, 31 JULY, 2000, 13:22 GMT 14:22 UK.

One of my clients whom I have personally managed his portfolio for 10 years now was a victim of a fatal car crash. His name is Late Mr Saud Ed Abad AlKharj, he was survived by a fiance and a two-year-old son from her as they intended getting married but where trying to be cautious because of Islamic law attitude on adultery. This were his only family and no next of kin, as he was the only child of Late Sheikh Hamza Al Kharj Al Faisal, who received royalties from the Kuwaiti Government on one of his fields which oil was discovered and subsequently explored (the Al Jazriah Oil Field).<BR>&nbsp;<BR>All subsequent investigation to find a next of kin was privately conducted by me and was futile. It was at this juncture that I and other officials Managing his portfolio and 2 bank managers where he had his accounts now <BR>decided to make this proposal and transfer ownership of the portfolio to an Agreeing party as beneficiary to the portfolio of the deceased.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The reason why ownership cannot be transferred to his wife to be and only son is that Islamic law will not recognize such and if an attempt is made on that it may put her in trouble with the authorities for giving birth outside <BR>marriage. So we have decided to help her by making this proposal and making sure she gets a substantial part of Late Mr Saud AlkharjÃ¯Â¿Â½s property for her <BR>and her son.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>You must be asking where I got your mail address, it was made available to me by a junior director Mrs Cynthia Philips in charge of customer services on request for contacts for investment expansion for a client but she is not aware of this contact. All records and accounts regarding the assets of deceased were managed by me for 10 years running, if you are interested to assist us, all I will do is to incorporate in the old records recognizing <BR>you as the only beneficiary.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The banking law here stipulates that if such portfolio remains unclaimed after four years it will go to the public department. The need for a foreigner as beneficiary is occasioned by the fact that the deceased was not <BR>permanently resident in Switzerland.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>For your assistance, we made up of I, 2 senior directors in my firm and 2 bank managers in banks which the Kuwaiti Government pay royalties, accruing to the deceased have agreed in fairness to make available 25% of all bank <BR>funds cleared and 15% of the royalties which you will continue to receive on behalf of the deceased as sole beneficiary every year. However we do not intend to share any interest with you as far as the estates and property are <BR>concerned, as they will be going to the surviving wife and child.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>If you are okay with the above explanations, you may reply us including all your contact telephone and fax numbers so that we may confirm you genuine, after which we will make more information available to you on how we will <BR>proceed.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I must further assure you that this transaction is 100% legitimate and the modalities for this transaction is being handled by top executives which assure a risk free transaction.Kindly visit my firms website at <A href=\"http://www.royaltrust.com\">www.royaltrust.com</A>.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>We await your timely response.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Best Regards<BR>&nbsp;<BR>DR PETER CLAPTON<BR></BODY></HTML>--= Multipart Boundary 1030031655--Dear Sir=2CIs a pleasure to write you this letter=2C and i hope it will not be a surprised to you=2C i got your contact through internet connector for urgent help=2E I think this letter will meet your favourable considration=2E=2E I am a rebel soldier from Angola=2C with a rank of Major in the Army and a rebel leader as well=2E We have been in the bush for more than 15yrs=2C my name is Major John Ogari born 48 yrs ago in Angola and a member of the Angola rebel leaders committee=2E=2E The federal forces are impressing us badly that we can not have a way to be in the city=2C all our contacts closed=2E Please kindly help=2E Indeed=2C we never give up since we are fighting for good of our country as our present leaders are bad=2E Here is the help we urgently needed from you=2C we have in our custody the sum of Nine million four hundred and twenty one dollar=2E 9=2E421=2E000 million=2Cdollar=2C with 103 kg of gold=2E i need your help to bank this in your account as i can not go out nor operate any account=2E I give you this trust as God will be in between us and you will benefit more than expected if you did not think other wise=2E=2E This can be transfered hand to hand through security company we operate with=2C i am hundred percent sure of that=2C and they will take care of the goods till it get to your hand safely=2E Although the secourity company did not know what is inside as we locked the money and gold inside a safe box and deposited as family treasure=2E There is no risky involve or distorbance easy transfer=2E My aim is to invest in a profitable business in your country=2EI hope you will help us in this our request=2E For further directives of how to achieve this feat=2E Reply and ask question if any and do not forget to furnish me with your cofidential telephone and fax number=2C to enable me contact you for immediate transacion=2E You will be made a co-beneficary to his treasure=2E Note that there is no risky involve in this busniess like i said earlier=2C and a good percentage will be given to you at end of this business=2E On arrival of the treasure safe to your destination i will come along with key to the safe box=2E Looking forward to hear from you soon=2E Best regardMaj=2E John Ogari=2EDear Sir,I am Engr.

I am writing you this letter with so much joy and excitement even though my heart goes out to the very powerfuland distinguished gentleman who I was fortunate to have worked for and extremely privileged to have known for numerous years.I am a top official in charge of client accounts in EQUITABLE PCI BANK inside the Philippines.In 2001, my client was going through a horrendous divorce in the United States Of America and Was on the verge of losing most of his estate to his vicious and diabolical wife. As a result of this alarming predicament, my client came to me with a very brilliant idea. He transferred some funds, ten million two hundred thousand dollars($10.2m) to a fixed deposit account in my bank under an alias which only the two of us knew about as the confidentiality of the matter was necessary for his protection.Due to his untimely death in early 2002, the funds have been sitting in the account ever since and will continue to do so perpetually unless we do something about it. This is where you come in. I located you through an agency that helps seek people by their email.My client did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paperwork of his bank deposit. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I would like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to our client so that you will be able to receive his funds.

dire need of assistance.I am Mrs.Monica Yangani, writing to you from Government Reserved Area (GRA).I got your contact information from the Republic of Congo Chamber of Commerce and Industry. When I was searching for a reliable individual or private company that can assist me to transfer a reasonable amount in a safe account abroad on behalf of my late husband, two sons and two daughters. I decided to solicit your assistance to transfer this sum of US $20 Million (Twenty Million, United States Dollars)inherited from my late husband in to your personal companyÃ¢ÂÂs account or private account.Before his death, he was a Brigadier in charge of arms and ammunition procurement for the (DRC) army. In his WILL?he specifically draws my attention to this US$ 20 Million which he deposited in a safe box in Private Security Company in South Africa. ÃÂ During the war, he was very dedicated and committed to winning the war against the rebels until when he found out that some Senior Army Officers and Government Functionaries were busy helping themselves with government funds and properties and sending them toforeign countries. Due to this, he and his former special advisers to the president were assigned by the President (Laurent Kabila) to purchase arms in South Africa, they saw this as a golden opportunity and diverted the money and divided it and he got a total sum of US $20 Million. He deposited the box in my sonÃ¢ÂÂs name and him alone with the deposit code canclaim it.I will be grateful if you can assist us now. I want you to do for us as an international partner to help us transfer this money which is in a safety box in the Security Company using your name as the beneficiary ofthis sum. You can contact ÃÂ me or my son (George Yangani) ÃÂ inSouth Africa on ÃÂ this number+27 8046828612. Then, we will tell you more details about it. We are in position to inform you of the whole procedures mapped out of the transfer of this money.We have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum for your assistance, 5% for any expenses that might occur from both sides in the course of this transaction,while the remaining 70% will be for my son's investment, which you will assist him to do abroad.Further information and arrangement will commence as soon as trust, confidence and good relationship will be established and safety of this fund assured when transferred to your account.Please treat this matter with utmost urgency.May Allah (God) bless you as I earnestly hope for yourassistance.

Box 44252,Nairobi.Kenya Email:dan@danielm.orgDear Sir/Madam, May I crave your indulgence to open this business discussion with you by an informal letter of this sort. It is pertinent that a business of this magnitude should have commenced properly with a formal meeting between you and us to enable both parties know ourselves, have a fore knowledge of the nature of the business, discuss and acquaint ourselves with the responsibilities and functions of both parties and appropriate shares accordingly.I am Dan Wilson Branch Manager of Kenya Commercial Bank in Kenya.This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition. On June 6, 2001,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Kenya Ministry Of Energy, Mr.Clifford Stone made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00,(Twenty-One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident. On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email:Thanks and my regards.

Ihave not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared foranyone(not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was nevergenerous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on mybusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as Inow know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make allthe money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance tocome to this  world I would live my life a different way from how Ihave lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given mostof my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members aswell as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me andaccept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, asI want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, Ihave distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeriaand Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of myaccounts and distribute the money which I have there to charityorganization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money tothemselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to becontended with whatI have left for them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the hugecash deposit of  eighteen million united states dollars that I havewith a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collectthis deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.I have set aside twenty percent for you and for yourtime.God be with you.regardsMRS WU YUNGGoodday,Thanks for your response to my email.

Unfortunately, my client Mr Shouwkat Kahlil was one of the passengers that died in the ill-fated plane crash involving a Boeing 727 UTA chartered flight that took off from Cotonou, Republic of Benin and crashed into the Atlantic ocean on Thursday, 25 December 2003.

Thus I seek your assistance in moving this family Deposits (FD) into your account for safekeeping pending myarrival in your country for investment purposes.On your consent, I shall provide you with a POWER OF ATTORNEY to collectthis deposit with the security company OVERSEAS on our behalf.

I cannot release the fund from hisaccount unless someone applies for claim as thenext-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in ourbanking guidelines. Having made a very  exhaustive search forany family member that would lay claim to this fund, Idecided to take my chance with you.I now seek yourpermission to have you stand as next of kin to thedeceased as I have all documentations including hiscertified Death Certificate that will facilitate yourstand as next of kin to him as he had a closingbalanced of 5,500,000.00 Five million five hundred thousand British pounds sterling) here inour bank in united kingdom. I also have secured from theprobate an order of mandamus to locate any member ofdeceased family to become beneficiary of this fund.

Bank Address.....Account Name....... Account Number.......Routing Number......... State Country....................Thanks. Yours Faithfully, Dr. Frank JomasDear FriendThis letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a =day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. I am Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, currently Head of Corporate affairs with a =reputable bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to =reveal to you.I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On =November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) =for 36 calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my =bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003, as his account =officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address =but the letter was returned undelivered. After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned =and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand =of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. =On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser=92s family wife and =two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, =including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under =dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the =investigation I have made so far, my bank management is not aware of it, I am the only one that have the information.With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to =support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law =which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not =for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the =money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the money. I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and =that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to =late Al Nasser, coupled with my present position and status in the bank as =Head of Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, =with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. =All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and =there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under =a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside =U. A. E is porous and anything goes.If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share =the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over =the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the =deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your =GOOD MORNING.DONÃ¯Â¿Â½T BE OFFENDED IF I MAY HAVE DISTURBED YOUR DAILY ACTIVITIES.MY NAME IS MR NOEL PANGA, I AM A BANKER, AND I WORK WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK AS A SENIOR STAFF. I HAVE DECIDED TO CONTACT YOU ON A BUSINESS TRANSACTION THAT WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO BOTH OF US AT THE END OF THE TRANSACTION .DURING OUR INVESTIGATION AND AUDITING IN THIS BANK, MY DEPARTMENT CAME ACROSS A VERY HUGE SUM OF MONEY BELONGING TO A DECEASED PERSON WHO DIED IN A PLANE CRASH AND THE FUND HAS BEEN DORMANT IN HIS ACCOUNT WITH THIS BANK WITHOUT ANY CLAIM OF THE FUND IN OUR CUSTODY EITHER FROM HIS FAMILY OR RELATION BEFORE OUR DISCOVERY TO THIS DEVELOPMENT.THE SAID AMOUNT WAS U.S 18.4M (EIGHTEEN MILLION,FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS). AS IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW, I GOT YOUR IMPRESSIVE CONTACTS THROUGH INTERNET. MEANWHILE ALL THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT TO PUT CLAIM OVER THIS FUND AS THE BONAFIDE NEXT OF KIN TO THE DECEASED, AND TRANSFER THIS MONEY TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE.  THE DIRECTIVES AND NEEDED INFORMATION WILL BE RELAYED TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU INDICATE YOUR INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST ME, AND ALSO BENEFIT YOUR SELF TO THIS GREAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.IN FACT I COULD HAVE DONE THIS DEAL ALONE BUT BECAUSE OF MY POSITION IN THIS COUNTRY AS A CIVIL SERVANT(A BANKER),WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE A FOREIGN ACCOUNT AND WOULD EVENTUALLY RAISE AN EYE BROW ON MY SIDE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER BECAUSE I WORK IN THIS BANK. THIS IS THE ACTUAL REASON WHY IT WILL REQUIRE A SECOND PARTY OR FELLOW WHO WILL FORWARD CLAIMS AS THE NEXT OF KIN WITH AFFIDAVIT OF TRUST OF OATH TO THE BANK AND ALSO PRESENT A FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE HE WILL NEED THE MONEY TO BE RE-TRANSFERRED INTO ON HIS REQUEST AS IT MAY BE AFTER DUE VERIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION BY THE CORRESPONDENT BRANCH OF THE BANK WHERE THE WHOLE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED FROM TO YOUR OWN DESIGNATION BANK ACCOUNT.I WILL NOT FAIL TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE.ON SMOOTH CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 40% OF THE TOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION, WHILE 10% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO TAKE CARE OF EXPENSES THAT MAY ARISE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER AND ALSO TELEPHONE AND INTERNET BILLS, WHILE 50% WILL BE FOR ME.  PLEASE, YOU HAVE BEEN ADVICED TO KEEP \"TOP SECRET\" AS I AM STILL IN SERVICE AND INTEND TO RETIRE FROM SERVICE AFTER WE CONCLUDE THIS DEAL WITH YOU.I WILL BE MONITORING THE WHOLE SITUATION HERE IN THIS BANK UNTIL YOU CONFIRM THE MONEY IN YOUR ACCOUNT AND ASK ME TO COME DOWN TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR SUBSEQUENT SHARING OF THE FUND ACCORDING TO PERCENTAGES PREVIOUSLY INDICATED AND FURTHER INVESTMENT, EITHER IN YOUR COUNTRY OR ANY COUNTRY YOU ADVICE US TO INVEST IN. ALL OTHER NECESSARY VITAL NFORMATION WILL BE SENT TO YOU WHEN I HEAR FROM YOU.IF THE TRANSACTION INTEREST YOU, GET BACK TO ME WITH YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO CALL YOU SO WE COULD PROCEED.THANKS.MR NOEL

I am Dr Idris Ali, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have been adviced to keep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when I hear from you.I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,Yours faithfully,Dr Idris Ali._________________________________________________________________Windows Live Messenger : venez tester la version bÃ¯Â¿Â½ta ! http://www.ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=5d21c51a-b161-4314-9b0e-4911fb2b2e6d            APPEAL FOR URGENT ASSISTANCE.

DEMANDING URGENT ATTENTION/CALL ME.Please for more confidentiality of this transaction, i hereby advise that you should kindly reply me through this mail address that is more secured (great_investment@omaninfo.com).May I crave your indulgence to open this business discussion by a formal letter of this sort. It is pertinent that a business of this magnitude should have commenced properly with a formal meeting of you and us to enable us know ourselves, have a fore knowledge of the nature of the business, discuss and acquaint ourselves with the responsibilities and functions of parties concerned, and appropriate shares accordingly. However, for time factor, confidentiality and personality of people involved here in Nigeria, we choose this approach for the remittance of this Fourty Five Million U.S. Dollars (US$45M). Please bear with us for making the initial contact through e-mail. But my partners are insisting for a meeting in order not to fall into a wrong hand again. I am Dr Ali Mohammed,we are members of the special committee for Budget and Planning of the Ministry Petroleum. This committee is principally concerned with contract appraisal and the approval of the contracts in order of priorities as regards capital projects of the past military government of Nigeria.With our positions, we have successfully secured for ourselves this sum of Fourty Five Million U.S. Dollars (US$45M). This amount was accumulated through undeclared windfall sales of crude oil during the gulf war.Hence together with two of our top officials at the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), we plan to transfer this amount of money into a secure overseas account by awarding a sort of contract from the NNPC. To this effect I have been given the mandate by my colleagues to contact you and ask for your assistance. What we need from you is to provide a nice account in which the funds will be transferred.

Can you be my partner on this?INTRODUCTION OF MY SELF:I am MR. KIMAEVA LIOUDMILA, a personal secretary toMikhail Khodorkovsky one of the richest man in RussiaWith good faith i have come to you on this proposalwhich i feel youare liable of handling, and firstly i must introduce myself,i am PRINCE PHILIPGARBI, the first son and manager of Mr. GarbiThembe, one of the mostpopular black farmers in Zimbabwe who was recentlymurdered in the landdispute in my country.I got your contact through network online hencedecided to write you,Before the death of my father, he took me toJohannesburg to deposit thesum of US29 million ( twenty-nine million, United Statesdollars), in one of the private security company, ashe foresaw thelooming danger in Zimbabwe, this money was depositedin a box as familyvaluables to avoid much demurrage from securitycompany. This amount wasmeant for the purchase of new machines and chemicalsfor a new Farmestablishment in Swaziland.This land problem came when Zimbabwean PresidentMr.Robert Mugabeintroduced a new Land Reform Act wholly affectingthe rich white farmersand some few black farmers, and this resulted to thekilling and mobbingby Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in thesociety. In fact alot of people were killed because of this Landreform Act of which myfather was one of the victims.It is against this background that, my family and Ifled Zimbabwe forfear of our lives and are currently staying in theNetherlands where weare seeking political asylum and more so havedecided to transfer myfather's fund to a more reliable foreign account,Since the law ofNetherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) toopen any bank accountor to be involved in any financial transactionthroughout theTerritorial zone of Netherlands.As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled withthe responsibility ofseeking a genuine foreign account where this moneycould be transferredwithout the knowledge of my government who are benton taking everythingwe have got. Since the South African governmentseems to be playingalong with them, I am now faced with the dilemma ofmoving this fund outof South Africa for fear of going through the sameexperience in futurebecause both countries have similar politicalhistory.As a businessman, I am seeking for a partner who Ihave to entrust myfuture and that of my family in his hands, I mustlet you know that thistransaction is risk free. If you accept to assist meand my family all Iwant you to do for me, is to make an arrangementswith the securitycompany to clear the consignment (funds) from theiraffiliate officehere in the Netherlands as i have already givendirectives for theconsignment to be brought to the Netherlands fromSouth Africa. Butbefore then all modalities will have to be put inplace like change ofownership to the consignment and more importantlythis money I intend touse for investment.I have two options for you. Firstly you can chooseto have certainpercentage of the money for nominating your accountfor thistransaction. Or you can go into partnership with mefor a properprofitable investment in your country. Whicheveroption you want, feelfree to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of thismoney for all kindsof expenses incured in the process of thistransaction. If you do notprefer a partnership I am willing to give you 10% ofthe money while theremaining 85% will be for my investment in yourcountry.

Duringmy husband's regime as president of Philippine, Irealized some reasonable amount of money from variousdeals that I successfully executed. I have plans toinvest this money for my children's future on realestate and industrial production.My husband is not aware of this because I wish to doit secretly for now. before my husband was impeached,I secretly siphoned the sum of $30,000,000million USD (Thirty million United states dollars) outof Philippines and deposited the money with a securityfirm that transports valuable goods and consignmentsthrough diplomatic means.I am contacting you because I want you to go to thesecurity company and claim the money on my behalfsince I have declared that the consignment belong tomy foreign business partner. You shall also berequired to assist me in investment in your country. Ihope to trust you as a God fearing person who will notsit on this money when you claim it, rather assist meproperly, I expect you to declare what percentage ofthe total money you will take for your assistance.When I receive your positive response I willlet you know where the security company is and thepayment pin code to claim the money which is veryimportant.For now, let all our communication is by e-mailbecause my line are right now connected to thePhilippines Telecommunication Network services.Please also send me your telephone and fax number.I will ask my son contact you to give you more detailson after i have received a responce from you.through thisemail address  mrssliocestrada@netscape.netThank you and God bless you and family.MRS LOI C ESTRADA  --6dea1291-bd30-4769-8523-a4dfe790d0de--<html><div style='background-color:'><DIV><DIV><DIV><DIV><DIV><DIV><P><STRONG>Dear Sir,/Madam ,</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>I am Princess&nbsp;Adama Williams, daughter of HRH King Solomon Abonmie Williams, the king of Ogoni Kingdom.

My mother did not bear any male child for him. Which implies that all my father'properties, Companies e.g., we have no share in them because my mother has no male child according to African Tradition.</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>My father therefore secretly gave me all the relevant documents of the said money, and told me that I should use this money with my mother and my younger sisters because he knows that traditionally; if he dies we cannot get anything, as inheritance.

I am 59 years old and was diagnosed for cancer about 2 years ago,immediately after the death of my husband, who had left me everything he worked for.I have been touched by God to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to the you for the good work of God,rather than allow my relatives to use my husband's hard earned funds ungodly.I  have asked God to forgive me all my sins and i believe he has because He is a merciful God. I will be going in for an operation,and i pray that i survive the operation. I have decided to WILL/donate the sum of $1,500,000(One million five hundred thousand dollars) to you for the good work of the lord, and to help the motherless,less privileged and also for the assistance of the widows.At the moment I cannot take any telephone calls, due to the fact that my relatives are around me and i have been restricted by my doctor from taking telephone calls because i deserve all thee rest i can get.Presently,I have informed my lawyer about my decision in WILLING this fund to you.I wish you all the best and may the good Lord bless you abundantly, and please use the funds well and always extend the good work to others. Kindly Contact my lawyer through this email address >(brownwalter03@yahoo.com)if you are interested in carrying out this task,so that he can arrange the release of the funds ($1,500,000.00) to you.My lawyer's name is Brown Walter.

Since the death of  our client Late Prime Minister of Lebanon,Mr. Rafik Hariri,none of his benefactors has  come forward to claim the consignment with us, which means that non of his relatives or Aids had any knowledge of this consignment. Hence out ofcuriosity I decided to secretly open the box that our client depositedin our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the metal box thatwere registered as treasures by our client actually  contained aconsiderable amount of money in United States Dollars amounting toabout US$25Million US Dollar. Since this development I have beennursing plans secretly. I also found out from enquiries and theforeign media that our late client siphoned a lot of money from hiscountry while he was in office as Prime Minister, It is my convictionthat the consignment in our vault was part of the money that ourclient siphoned and now that he is dead there is no trace to thismoney in our care. After going through his (WILL) I Found that he stated that the treasure should be used to support (Islamic race).Finally, I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assistme in transferring this money out of South Africa to your country forimmediate investment. I have also decided that you will generously beentitled to 40% of the total amount. Upon my receipt of your replyconfirming your willingness to assist me of this transaction, I Will immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance andtransfer of the complete funds to your country for onwards investment.This transaction is 100% risk free.

However, this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated as such. At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, a program leader.Until his death,The Late PrimeMinister, Mr. Rafik Hariri, has a huge investment here in the United Kingdom and all over the world, as a matter of fact he has the sum of(THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) in his account here in London which he deposited as a family valuables.The family do not know about this deposit.I was on a routine inspection that I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody will come again for the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder, Therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction.

Kofi Achampong.Dear,I am the head of Accounts and Audit Department of Bank of Africa,Ouagadougou . I decided to contact you after a careful thought that you may be capable of handling this business transaction which i explained below;In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5m US dollars (Ten million, five hundred thousand US dollars). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in 1998 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that his supposed next of kin(his son and wife) died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim .It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin (We want to present you as his busines asociate )to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained Unclaimed after seven years, the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner .We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me and my colleagues.There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to your account as arranged,you must apply first to the bank as next of kin of the deceased customer. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.I expect that you contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.Hoping to hear from you immediately.Yours faithfully,DR .ABU TOPIA_________________________________________________________________Retrouvez tout en un clin d'oeil avec la barre d'outil MSN Search ! http://desktop.msn.fr/                  \"MY GOOD WILL\"  I greet you in the name of God Almighty. I am former Mrs. Saleh Galal, now I am Mrs. Mary Saleh Galal a widow to Late Dr. Mohamed Galal. I am an old woman; suffering from cancer. From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live long, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very severe stage. My late husband died in an air crash on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline Boeing 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this fact from the website which was aired by the BBC WORLD NEWS:(http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm) and my only daughter died in LONDON ATTACK BOMB. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for so long and I am so scared about this. So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the well being of less privileged people and handicapped in the society of world America, Canada, Africa, Europe and Asian Countries. This mission, who will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocate to Africa where I live presently. I selected you for this Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of $7,300,000.00 Million US Dollars to you for the development of the well being of handicapped in the society and also as aids for the less privileged around your country, and i have map out $1,700.000.00 for your own personal use to help me for this work.  Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security Bank. Therefore, I forward to you immediate application for the transfer of the money in your name or your home. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use, than enhancement of the comfort of the Handicapped. Lastly, I want you/your home to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without God one's life is vanity upon vanity. I await your reply.Mrs. Saleh Galal <P><A href=3D\"http://www.rte.ieews/2000/0418/zimbabwe.html\">http://www.rte.ieews/2000/0418/zimbabwe.html</A> </P><P>I got yourcontact through a search on the internet<BR>here in South Africa.

Mr. Hope Sithole one of the Personal Assistants to the young President Joseph Kabila of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), since he assumed power.Sincerely speaking, my agitation is real, and my word is my bond in this proposal. This money in question is part of the budget made by our President Mr. Joseph Kabila, in the fear that members of the United Nations (UN) could perhaps be mandated to offer their respective supports in forcing Iraq to disarm themselves. Eventually, his dreams do not match up with realities and as a result he (the President) started using the money on personal ground because nobody could question/probe his actions, as he believed.</STRONG></DIV><DIV><STRONG>As his closest personal assistant and with the help of two other officials one of whom was the then deputy Director, Safety and Security Department, we were able to escape with two boxes containing the aforementioned sum. At present the boxes were deposited in a reputable Security firm here in South Africa and were registered as family belongings. We had agreed on the need for a foreign assistance with a legitimate bank account abroad, that will stand as, the beneficiary and partner as well in order to avoid suspicion, since we are existing as refugees here. Copies of certificate of Deposit as well as all necessary documents from the Security cc. are available for a hitch-free transaction.</STRONG></DIV><DIV><STRONG>In addition, you are also required to come/send a representative (as far as you trust the person representing) to the Republic of South Africa for the purpose of the transfer, but only if, by one reason or the other you cannot embark on a Five working (5) days trip by yourself, according to the expert from within the bank. As things are now we had not really agreed on the actual amount that should be your remuneration for your kind assistance, which to us is no big deal.

Front Page. <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\">www.yahoo.com</a>--0-930567302-1099896484=:25288--Dear sir,  It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's properties is under the authority of the family's lawyer Tony Musa.  My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband's wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the \"Personal will\" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f!urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this \"SOS\" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. <html><div

DR.OLUSEGUN SMITHFROM DIDI SITHOLE,JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.TELL:+27-732112866.Dear sir,I am MR, DIDI SITHOLE, the son of lateMR.PATRICK SITHOLE, who was murdered in a land disputein ZIMBABWE.I got your contact during my search forreliable&compitent foreigner to handle a confidentialfinancial transaction, then I decided to write you. Mylate father was among the few black Zimbabwean richfarmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of theruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for hisalleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean oppositionparty. Before the death of my father, he took me to SouthAfrica to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars($12m) with a security and finance company, as if heknew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money wasdeposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid muchdumourage from the security firm.This money was earmarked for the purchase of newmachinery and chemicals for the farms and theestablishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.This land problem arose when President R. MUGABEintroduced a new land Act. which wholly affects theWhite rich farmers and some few blacks vehementlycondemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by thegovernment. This resulted to rampant killing and mobactions. I and my family who are currently staying in SouthAfrica as refugees or asylum seekers have decidedto enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of theTrunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futhertransfer of the money to a foreign country where wecan invest it. I am faced with the dilemma ofclaiming/investing this amount of money in SouthAfrica for fear of encountering the same experience infuture since both countries have the same politicalhistory. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law doesnot allow such investment hence I am seeking foran asylum or refugee.I must let you know that this business is 100% riskfree and the nature of your business does notnecessary matter. So if you are willing to assist usclaim the ownership of this money,I and my family haveagreed to give you 20% of the total money, 40% will befor a joint business venture I will be doing with youand another 35% will be for me and my family which weshall also invest in your country and the remaining 5%will be mapped out for all expenses we may incureduring the transaction.Therefor, if you are willing and interested to renderthe needed assistance.

Before the death of my father, hehad taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum ofUSD$15,000,000(FIFTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS),in aSecurity Company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of newmachines and chemicals for the farms and the establishmentof the new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came whenZimbabwean President MR.ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new LandAct which wholly affected the rich white farmers and somefew black farmers. This resulted to the killing and mobaction by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in thesociety.=20Infact, alot of people have been killed because of thisland reformed Act for which my father was one of thevictims. It is against this background, that I and myfamily who are currently staying in South Africa decided totransfer my father's money to foreign account since the lawof South Africa prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to openany bank account or to be involved in any financialtransaction.=20As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with theresponsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account wherethis money could be transferred without the knowledge of mygovernment who are bent on taking everything we have got. Iam faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of moneyin South Africa for fear of going through the sameexperience in future since both countries have similarpolitical history. Moreover,the South African ForeignExchange policy does not allow such investment as an asylumseeker. As a businessman, whom I have entrusted my futureand of my family in his hands,I must let you know that thistransaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and myfamily,all I need you to do for me is to make arrangementand come to Johannesburg -South Africa so that you can opena non-resident account which will aid us in transferringthe money into any account you will nominate overseas.=20This money I intend to use for investment. I have twooptions for you,firstly you can choose to have a certainpercentage of the money for nominating your account forthis transaction. Or you can go into partnership with mefor the proper profitable investment of the money in yourcountry. Which ever the option you want,feel free to notifyme as I have also mapped out5% of this money for all kindsof expences incurred in the proccess of this transaction.Ifyou do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you20% of the money while the remaining 75% will be for myinvestment in your country.=20Contact me with the above telephone number while I imploreyou to maintain the absolute secrecy required in thistransaction. And no matter the level of transaction we are,you must call me on phone first before sending areply.Please, You should keep this transaction secret andconfidential.=20  Best regards and God bless=20Mr Vuyo Gwala(For the family)=20 \t\t\t=09---------------------------------Want to be your own boss?

In an account that belongs to one= of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on (July 21,= 2003) in a plane crash.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this busin=ess is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner,and a Burki=nabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this= money will be for you as foreign partner,in respect to the provision of a =foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the bus=iness and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague.

I am Mr.Jonathan Bongani the son of Dr. Simon Bongani,who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through the South Africa Informations Exchange (S.A.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you, my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority.   Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg -South Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 35.5 Million (Thirty-five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was depositedin a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the \"modus operandi\" adopted by the government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs.  precisely, More than thirty-one (31) people have so far been killed.Heads of governments from the west, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe's plan. Subsequently, South African Development Community(S.A.D.C) has continously supported Mugabe's new land act, it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father's money into a foreign account.   As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa's government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history.More so, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an \"ASYLUM\".   As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.For your assistance,we are offering you 30% of the total sum,60% for me and my family while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we may incure during the course of this transaction.We wish to invest ourpart of the money on commercial property based on your advice. Finally,all we demand from you is assurance that you will not sit on this money when it finally gets to your personal or company's account in your country.  If this proposal is acceptable by you, please confirm your interest via the above TELEPHONE number +27-83-424-7661or E-MAIL to the above address. Best Regards.

I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my client bank who perished with his whole families on 25THJULY,2000 in CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] withthe whole passengers on board.During the course of my auditing work with my client bank, I discovered an account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. Since his death, I further investigated with keen interest to see if i can get any relative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knowsabout this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of his company.The total amount involved is $36,000,000.00 USD.[Thirty Six Million United States Dollar]. We wish to start the first transfer with $10,000,000.00[Ten million] and upon successful transaction without anydisappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.I have secretly discussed this matter with a close confidant attorney whom I must involve in order to assist us produce legal back-up documents which would substantiate your claims and also enable us have a smooth and successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary ofthe fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred.The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy. In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount inhis or her personal account. At the conclusion of the transfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased.AX:&nbsp; 27-76197-0308</DIV>  <DIV><BR>DEAR SIR, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=bsp;&nbsp; STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL <BR>You may be surprised to =recieve this letter from me, since<BR>you don't know me personally.Thus, =I have to introduce<BR>myself.I am MR.Vuyo Gwala ,the first son of Late M=R.Tijani<BR>gwala a farmer and leader movement for democratic<BR>change[M=DC] in Zimbabwe until recently, he was murdered in<BR>the land dispute in= Zimbabwe. <BR>I was furnished with viable information from the<BR>Intern=ational Trade Centre here in Johannesburg and I<BR>decided to write to yo=u. Before the death of my father, he<BR>had taken me to Johannesburg to d=eposit the sum of<BR>USD$15,000,000(FIFTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS=),in a<BR>Security Company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in<BR>&nb=sp;Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of new<BR>machines and chemicals for the farms and the esta=blishment<BR>of the new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when<B=R>Zimbabwean President MR.ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new Land<BR>Act whic=h wholly affected the rich white farmers and some<BR>few black farmers. T=his resulted to the killing and mob<BR>action by Zimbabwean war veterans =and some lunatics in the<BR>society. <BR>Infact, alot of people have been= killed because of this<BR>land reformed Act for which my father was one =of the<BR>victims. It is against this background, that I and my<BR>family= who are currently staying in South Africa decided to<BR>transfer my fath=er's money to foreign account since the law<BR>of South Africa prohibits =a refugee (asylum seeker) to open<BR>any bank account or to be involved i=n any financial<BR>transaction. <BR>As the eldest son of my father, I am =saddled with the<BR>responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account w=here<BR>this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my<BR>government who are bent on taking everyth=ing we have got. I<BR>am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount =of money<BR>in South Africa for fear of going through the same<BR>experie=nce in future since both countries have similar<BR>political history. Mor=eover,the South African Foreign<BR>Exchange policy does not allow such in=vestment as an asylum<BR>seeker. As a businessman, whom I have entrusted =my future<BR>and of my family in his hands,I must let you know that this<=BR>transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my<BR>family,=all I need you to do for me is to make arrangement<BR>and come to Johanne=sburg -South Africa so that you can open<BR>a non-resident account which =will aid us in transferring<BR>the money into any account you will nomina=te overseas. <BR>This money I intend to use for investment. I have two<BR=>options for you,firstly you can choose to have a certain<BR>percentage o=f the money for nominating your account for<BR>this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me<BR>for t=he proper profitable investment of the money in your<BR>country. Which ev=er the option you want,feel free to notify<BR>me as I have also mapped ou=t5% of this money for all kinds<BR>of expences incurred in the proccess o=f this transaction.If<BR>you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to =give you<BR>20% of the money while the remaining 75% will be for my<BR>in=vestment in your country. <BR>Contact me with the above telephone number =while I implore<BR>you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this<=BR>transaction. And no matter the level of transaction we are,<BR>you mus=t call me on phone first before sending a<BR>reply.Please, You should kee=p this transaction secret and<BR>confidential. </DIV>  <DIV>Best regards =and God bless <BR>Mr Vuyo Gwala<BR>(For the family) </DIV><p>&#32;=09=09\t\t<hr size=3D1>Want to be your own boss?

We are nowliving in South Africa as political Asylum seekers and financial laws andregulation of the Republic of  South Africa do not permit us financial rights to suchhuge sum of money. In view of this, I cannot invest this  fund in South africa, hencei am prepared to offer  you 20% of the total fund, while 10% will be set asidefor local and international expenses and 70% will be for  my family and me.Finally, modalities on howthe transfer will be bone  will be conveyed to you once wehave established  trust and confidence between ourselves.

William, thetraditional ruler of Bonny province in the Oil rich area of Rivers state inNigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of USD45, 000,000.00(Forty Five Million United States Dollars), which I inherited from my latefather.As You may be aware that my country is the third largest oil producingcountry in the whole world. My father is the ruler of the richest communityin Nigeria. My community produce 5.8% of the total annual Oil production inNigeria and 0.5% of the Dollar value of each barrel is paid to my father asroyalty by the Federal Government to our community. In his position as theroyal head and chairman of the Bonny Oil trust fund.Foreigners often refer to his kingdom as the Gas/Oil Land. This is becausethe island floats atop one of the largest gas and oil deposits anywhere inthe world. This explains is why the island is home to several Multinationaloil companies, such as Shell, Exxon-Mobil, Chevron and one of Nigeria's mostexpensive ventures in recent time, Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Company(NLNG), these companies also offers my father a lot of gratifications as theroyal father of the kingdom where they operate.Some of this money was accumulated from royalties paid to my father ascompensation by the Oil firms located in our area, for hampering Agriculturewhich is our main source of livelihood. Unfortunately my father died fromprotracted diabetes. Before his death secretely he willed the sum of USD45,000,000.00 (Forty Five Million United States Dollars) and he safelydeposited this money in cash into a consignment and kept it in the custodyof a security company without the security company knowing the content.I have the certificate of Deposit and any information you wish to have as aproof to show for it.My problem actually started when my stepmother said that the next king mustbe her son instead of me as the heir apparent to the throne. I am the firstson of my father but my stepmother has used her position and influence toconvince some members of the council of elders that my biological mother wasnot properly married to my father because my mother is not living in thepalace due to some problems within the family before the death of my father.This action by my step mother is just a bid to deny me of my right, which Ichallenged. In the process  there was confusion that divided the communityinto two factions. This led to a revolution by the youths and women who aresolidly behind me. Consequently, my international passport was seized justto stop me from traveling outside the country.Now I need help. I need someone who will claim the fund my father depositedwith the financial security company and deposit it in his/her personalaccount pending when I will be free again.

The late Rafik Hariri died on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kgof C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the Saint GeorgeHotel in the Lebanese capital, for more information please log on to{http://www.hariri.info}.After in the same year the consignment was entrusted into our care. Since the death of  our client Late Prime Minister of Lebanon,Mr. Rafik Hariri,none of his benefactors has  come forward to claim the consignment with us, which means that non of his relatives or Aids had any knowledge of this consignment. Hence out ofcuriosity I decided to secretly open the box that our client depositedin our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the metal box thatwere registered as treasures by our client actually  contained aconsiderable amount of money in United States Dollars amounting toabout US$25Million US Dollar. Since this development I have beennursing plans secretly. I also found out from enquiries and theforeign media that our late client siphoned a lot of money from hiscountry while he was in office as Prime Minister, It is my convictionthat the consignment in our vault was part of the money that ourclient siphoned and now that he is dead there is no trace to thismoney in our care. After going through his (WILL) I Found that he stated that the treasure should be used to support (Islamic race).Finally, I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assistme in transferring this money out of South Africa to your country forimmediate investment. I have also decided that you will generously beentitled to 40% of the total amount. Upon my receipt of your replyconfirming your willingness to assist me of this transaction, I Will immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance andtransfer of the complete funds to your country for onwards investment.This transaction is 100% risk free. Please maintain absoluteconfidentiality on this matter. Please reply on my private mail(jackkhumalo@sify.com)I await your most promptresponse.Yours faithfully,Mr. Jackson khumaloDear Sir or Madam:We are keenly interested in setting up a new factory to produce 120,000 ERW oil casings per year to meet the big market of Shengli Oilfied. Since we lack some starting-up capital, we are seeking for investments. I will give you a brief introduction to the project as follow:I. Background:Shengli Oilfield, the second largest oilfield in China and the leading company of Sinopec Corp. (http://www.sinopec.com), as well as neighboring oilfields as Dagang Oilfield, Central Plain Oilfield and Jiangsu Oilfield are potential market of ERW oil casing. It is expected that the total oil casing needed in the above area is about 400,000 tons, including 260,000 tons in Sinopec and 150,000 tons in Shengli Oilfield. To meet the great need, we plan to set up a joint venture to produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings per year in Shengli Oilfield.  With good management and market outlets, we believe that this JV also has the potential to expand beyond China to other nations. II. About usShengli Oilfield Engineering Machinery Factory is one of sub-companies of Shengli Oilfield Co., Ltd, with total assets of 267 million yuan, net assets of 170 million yuan and 2462 staff.

If it does not interest you, discard the mail but if it makes sense to you, I open my arms wide to do business with you.I take liberty anchored on strong desire to solicit for your assistance on this mutual beneficiary and risk free transaction with you, which I hope you give urgent attention. To be precise;Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black Economic Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to the United States during abilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties, and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business. Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of Project Implementation, with co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession, an overdue payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$41,500,000.00 (Forty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are the real engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it has continued to encouraged investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close relationship, and mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign account. The changing of beneficiary's information/ details and other forms of documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or yourself.  I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that, should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be 20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so incurred.  It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies. More often than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win major contracts, and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution. This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us. Kindly notify me for further details, upon your acceptance of this proposal.

We keep valuables for high net worth individuals, blue chip corporations and diplomatic organisations.I am contacting you in regards to our client, the late Chief (Mrs.) Stella Obasanjo, who died on Sunday October 23, 2005 in a surgical operation in Spain. This client has a total deposit of Thirty Two Million United States Dollars in our vaults. After the 9/11 incidents, our company policy do not permit cash deposit, so he confided in me as the foreign operations officer to make this deposit since June 2004. She did this to avoid traces f the money to her since her husband, president Olusegun Obansanjo was against any corruption and embezzlement of funds.The last communication I had with her was on the 25th of August 2005, where she was making arrangements to claim the deposit. Thereafter it was revealed that she died of a surgical operation in Spain in October.  After the acknowledgement of her death, it became apparent that there was no claim to her funds since she listed no next of kin in her bio-data form. She made the deposit under the name of Guardian Trust investment (GTI) and disclosed the content as company valuables and Antiques. This was for confidentiality and to reduce taxes.If no claim is made within six months, the company under its storage terms and conditions will legally auction the content of the deposit. If discovered that the content is cash, it will be confiscated and I would be penalised, since I accepted the cash deposit against the companyÃ¯Â¿Â½s regulations. As a staff, it is impossible for me to have access to the funds or claim it myself. More so, such valuable deposits are kept at a different branch, where we have our terminal facilities. Consequently, it is important that I find a credible candidate to play the role of the Trustee or representative of Guardian Trust investment to help claim the deposit.  It is on this ground that I need your assistance to claim the funds which will be possible with the information I hold. Once this is achieved, you shall be entitled to 50% of the total funds while I shall retain the balance 50%.I am aware of the risks involved in this proposal, therefore I ask that you consider the factors above and keep it strictly confidential. However, if you feel you are unable tofulfil this role, I request you discard of this letter.I look forward to hearing form you.Thank you.Mr Martins  Imaa  LucasFROM:RITA DOINK.INTERNATIONAL PROMOTIONS/PRIZE AWARD DEPARTMENTRESULTS FOR CATEGORY \"A\" DRAWS.Congratulations to you as we bring to your notice, the results of the First Category draws of THE HOLLAND CASINO LOTTO PROMO INT.

MABEL NDLOVU,the wife ofLate DR.ONOMUA ANDREW NDLOVU who was recentlymurdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe.I got your contact from the INTERNATIONAL TRADECENTRE here in Johhanesburg and decided to writeyou.My Husband was among the few black Zimbabwe richfamers murdered in the cold blood by the agents ofthe ruling governmentof President Robert MUGABE for hisalleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabweanopposition party,controlled by the white minority.Before his death,he had taken me to to deposite thesum of Five Million Dollars US$ 5M.with a securityand finance company as if he knew the looming danger inZimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box asgemstones to avoid much demurrage from the securitycompany. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new farmmachinery and chemicals for the establishment of our new farm inlesotho and Swaziland.This land problem arose when presidentRobert MUGABE introduced a new land act,which wholly affectedthe rich white famers and some blacks vehemently condemned themodusoperand\"adopted by the government. Thisresulted to rampant killings and mob actions by the warveterans and some political thugs presently,morethan SIX-HUNDRED[600]people have so far been killed.Heads ofgovernment from the west,especially The Great Britain and TheUnited states of America have voice their condemnation ofMUGABE'S plan.The South Africa development community (SADEC)hascontinuously supported MUGABE'S new land reformAct.It is against this background that I and my Children who arecurrently staying as REFUGEE in a SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC butcurrently seeking An ASSYLUM in any of THE THE WEST AFRICANCOUNTRIES have decided to transfer my late Husband's money intoa foreignaccount. As the only and LEGITIMATE -WIFE of my latehusband I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking agenuine foreign account where this money could betransfer without theknowledge of my country'sgovernment who are tatically freezing ourfamilieswealthback home in ZIMBABWE and The SouthAfrica government seems to be playing along withthem. I am faced with the delimma of investing this amount ofmoney in The South Africa Republic for the fear of encounteringthe same experience in future since both countries have almostthe same political history.Moreso ,the South Africa Financialforeign exchange policy does not allow such investment henceI am seeking for Assistance.As a business person whomI must entrust my future and that of my family on hishands,I must let you know that this transfer is 100%RISK FREE . Therefore if you accept to assist my family,we arewilling to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assitance,70%for me and my family,while 10% will be mapped out for allexpenses.I would wish to invest in your country on REAL- ESTATEbased on your advice and I would also receive assurance that youwould'nt sit on this money when transfered into your personalor company account. If this PLEA is acceptable by you please dosend me your personaldetails,Name and Address,telephone and fax numbers .You should know that this business is highly confidential and shallbe kept within you alone.I hope to hear from you soonon the  email address bellow.(mabel45@ureach.com)Thanks,Best Regards,MRS MABEL NDLOVU. ___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent from WebMail service at - http://yoursitenamehere.comGreeting,Sir,I am contacting you believing you are a honest and trustworthy person.I =believe you will not betray the confidence I am willing to repose in you, for =me to have contacted you even though we've not met before.My name is Martin Goudal=E9,the only son of late Mr.Hassan Goudal=E9, who was =the chairman /President/CEO,Cacao-Cafe & Agro-Alimentary industries =plc.SCAFECAO)\"Bouake\" and ex-owner of Polyclinic LA-MADONNE, of the Republic =of Cote d'Ivoire.You can find the story on thiswebsite:http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2269238.stmOn 19th of September 2002,a group of so called rebels took over the city of =Bouake to over-throw the Government of Mr.Laurent Gbagbo the President of =Cote d'Ivoire.

The more people who join in, the more profitable for everyone on the list. If you are going to use a mailing list, please make sure it is from a reputable source and includes people who have \"Opted In\". These lists contain names of people who have no objections to receiving these types of mails. <br><br>The e-mail that you will send out will contain a copy of this document in your new email message. (You can edit and format the message text in any way you want! However, it's best to just leave the text as it is because you want your email to be read by everyone who receives it).<br><br>Delete the e-mail address at No 1 in the list and move the others up one place (2 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2 etc)<br>No 5 in the list will be empty, so put YOUR address in this space. (This is the e-mail address you used to sign up to PayPal), your email is now ready for sending! <br>A word of warning! Don't be tempted to add your email address to position 1 in order to earn money fast! It doesn't work like that! If you do that, you will ONLY reach the people you directly send emails to, and then your address will be immediately removed from the No 1 place and you won't reach any more people! However, if you add your name to the No 5 position, there will be literally tens of thousands of people receiving and sending e-mail's later - when your name has reached the No 1spot!!! <br><br>When you send out your e-mails, your address will initially be at No 5 in the list. The response-rate for this program is much higher than any typical email marketing campaign for a number of reasons, which are explained later. <br>As long as you send your e-mails to people who are likely to be interested in this program, you can expect an average response from about 25% of the people you send to. Let's be conservative here and assume that you receive only an average response rate of 12.5%. <br>If you send out your email to 40 different people, you can expect at least 5 of those people to do exactly what you did (12.5% of 40 = 5). By this time, your email address will have moved up to No 4 in the list, and this list will now have reached around 200 people (5 x 40). <br>Out of those 200 people, you can expect at least 25 of them to participate (12.5% of 200 = 25), so that's a further 1,000 emails (25 x 40) being sent out and your email address will have risen to No 3 in the list. <br>Out of those 1,000 people, you can expect at least 125 of them to participate (12.5% of 1,000 = 125), so that's a further 5,000 emails (125 x 40) being sent out with you now at the No 2 position. <br>Out of those 5,000 people, you can expect at least 625 of them to respond (12.5% of 5,000 = 625), so that's 25,000 emails (625 x 40) being sent out with YOUR ADDRESS at the No 1 spot! <br>Now, out of those 25,000 people, you can expect around 3,125 of them to respond (12.5% of 25,000 = 3,125). And since you will now be at No 1 in the list, you will receive Ã¯Â¿Â½3 (Ã¯Â¿Â½5/$5) from each of them, that's; Ã¯Â¿Â½9,375 (3,125 x Ã¯Â¿Â½3(Ã¯Â¿Â½5/$5).<br> <br>So, when your name starts to hit the No 1 position within the next few days, it will be YOUR turn to collect the money! Over the course of 30 days the money will be sent to you, by a few thousand people just like yourself. The first payments will arrive within a few days, and they will continue at the rate of about 100 payments per day for about 30 days. After that time, the volume of payments begins to taper off as your e-mail address vacates the No 1 position. <br></body></html>------=_NextPart_AF_000021C_01E--------=_NextPart_AF_000021C_01C--FROM THE DESK OF DR AMAMAN LAZARE AUDITING DEPARTMENT BANK OF AFRICA.

I a MR. BALOYSITHOLE. from Angola. I am the first and only son ofBRIGADIER SITHOLE JONES. I am presently resident in SouthAfrica.I got your contact address from a business directory inJohannesburg Chamber of commerce and Industry. On behalf ofmy widowed mother MRS. ELIZABETH SITHOLE, I desided tosolicit for your assistance to transfer the sum of US$21.5MILLION( TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITEDSTATES DOLLARS)inherited from my late father, into yourpersonal/ company's account.Before my fathers' death, he was a Brigadier in charge ofArms and Ammunation procurement for the Angola Army. In hisWILL, he specifically drew my attentionto the said sum of money which he deposited in a safe boxof a private Security Company in Johannesburg- South Africain a treasure box, fully documented in myname. IN FACT MY FATHER SAID AND I QUOTE 'MY BELOVED SON, I WISHTO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO US$21.5 MILLION . I DEPOSITED THEBOX CONTAINING THIS MONEY IN A SECURITY COMPANY INJOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA. DURING THE WAR, I WAS VERYDEDICATED AND OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES WEREBUSSY HELPING THEMSELVES WITH GOVERNMENT FUNDS ANDPROPERTIES AND SENDING THEM TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES. DUE TOTHIS, WHEN I AND MY FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENTWERE ASSIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT (EDUARDO SANTOS) TO PURCHASEARMS IN SOUTH AFRICA, WE SAW THIS AS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITYAND DIVERTED THE MONEY AND DIVIDED IT. i GOT A TOTAL SUM OFUS$21.5 MILLION. IN CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH, AS ARESULT OF DEATH ONLY, YOU SHOULD SOLICIT FOR THE FUND FORINVESTMENT PURPOSES.'>From the above, you will understand that the lives andfuture of my family depens on this money, as such I will begrateful if you can assist us.

It is a privilege and it demands an utmost confidentiality and honesty. My name is Mrs. Mary Kabah wife of the former minister of mineral resources/economic planning in the presidency of tijan Kabah of Sierra Leone. My husband died recently as a result of an acute heart problem.Right now, the funds are in a security company which has affiliate offices in Europe, Asia and West African. I am currently on transit awaiting an honest overseas partner for negotiations.Though it is my desire to go into property investments or any other area of your choice you may advice. I will compensate for your assistance including any expenses you may incur before the successful completion of this transaction.So if youÃ¯Â¿Â½re interested to assist in this regard, kindly confirm this FROM MR.ABDUL UMARDIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF AUDITINGAND ACCOUNTING SECTION OF BANQUEGENERALE DU TOGO,LOME-TOGO IN WEST AFRICA.DEAR FRIENDPermit me to use this medium to first introduce myself to you before getting you acquinted with the transaction for which i am contacting you. I am Mr ABDUL UMAR, the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of BANQUE GENERALE DU TOGO, Lome Togo in west Africa.  With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction thatwill be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on 31st October 1999 in a plane crash;flight number 990 en route from new york to cairo which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean killing the 217passengers and crew members on board and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was us$14M (fourteen million united states dollars).  As it may interest you to know, I got yourimpressive information from the web directory of my country when searching for a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who could help me champion a business proposal of such magnitude without any problem.Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon asyou indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why itwill require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by thecorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 20% of the total sum asgratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 75% will be for me and my partners.Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in active service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.  I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to yourcountry for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in.All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you.

Best regardsBenlock<html><head><style>P{margin:0px;padding:0px}bodyDear Friend,Attention Please.Sorry to disturb you. I am Dr Idris Ali, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have been adviced to keep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when I hear from you.I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,Yours faithfully,Dr Idris Ali._________________________________________________________________Windows Live Mail : dÃ¯Â¿Â½couvrez et testez la version bÃ¯Â¿Â½ta ! http://www.ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=5d21c51a-b161-4314-9b0e-4911fb2b2e6dDear,I am Dr. M.

Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However, this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated as such.     At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties.     My name is MODISE ROBERT, I work as the operational manager in account management section in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of a prime banks here in South Africa. On  a  routine  inspection I Discovered  a  dormant  domiciliary  account  with  a Balance of  US$168,559,000. 00 (One hundred and sixty eight million five hundred and fifty nine thousand U.S dollars only}. The account holder[The deceased] was believed to be incharge of Former Iraq resident,Saddam Hussein secret CRUDE OIL transactions in Africa before his  death. On further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has died long ago with his family on a fatal Auto- Accident leaving no beneficiary to the account and no other person knows about this account.     I am in close contact with the manager of the bank here who is my partner and he is willing to approve the transfer to any reliable and trustworthy foreigner with foreign bank account because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that he has no writen or oral WILL attached to the account ,no beneficiary and  nobody will come again for the claim of this money. It is only a foreigner who can claim this money with legal claims to the account holder which I will provide to you if you are interested, therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. This money will remain useless in this dormant account if I did not transfer the fund out to a foreign account.  I will provide the necessary information and documents needed in order to claim this money. I only need your cooperation as a foreigner to provide your safe bank account information for the transfer. All arrangement that will ensure a smooth transfer of the fund to the account which you are to nominate is already in place.You should provide me with your correct account information for the transfer and your direct cell phone lines for easy communication. I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction.  At the conclussion of this transaction, your share will be 15% of the  total transfer sum, 80% for me and my partner while 5% will be set aside for any expenses both parties might incure during the process of the transfer. The fund will be transferred to your account in two parts. I will first transfer USD 38 Million to your account as a test  transfer. I will fly over to meet you after the successful transfer for sharing according to the agreed percentages. I will have the remaining balance of USD130,559 Million transferred to your account  only after the successful sharing of the first transfer without any disappointment from your side.

I have beendiagnosed with Esophageal cancer.It has defiled all forms of medicaltreatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live,accordingto medical experts.I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared fo=ranyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I wasnever generous,I was always hostile to people and only focused on mybusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all thi=sas I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or mak=eall the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I wouldlive my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God hascalled me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to myimmediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided togive also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of thelast good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to somecharity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that myhealth has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts anddistribute the money which I have there to charity organization inBulgaria and Pakistan,they refused and kept the money to themselves.Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended withwhat I have left for them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit ofEighteen Million Dollars $18,000,000,00 in side two boxes that I havewith a Finance/Security Company Abroad. I will want you to Act as myBeneficiary who will help me contact the security finance company on mybehalf to discuss the terms and condition of getting this deposit out fro=mthier custody and also helping me to dispatch it to the charityorganisations.Reply to this email with your full names,contact address,tel number andfax to enable me ask my doctors lawyer to arrange for you a power ofattorney that will give you full legal backing as my beneficiary.I have set aside 30% for you and for your time.Please kindly reply to my most confidential email if you are reallyinterested in helping me please:saeedahmed631@yahoo.comoo.comGod be with you.Saeed AhmedIn view of the yearly sweepstake of the Onlae Group organization held on the14th of June,2006.It is my pleasure to inform you that your e-mail addressattached to the above Ref ans Batch Numbers came up in the first dip.This invariably means that you have emerged as the prize recipient in thefirst category with an allocated sum of Seven Hundred and Sixty ThousandFive  Hundred and Ten Euros Twenty Four Cent (_760.510.24).

My name is BarristerPhilip Wilson Esq,legal practitioner and Attorney to late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev who died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000. You may follow the Link below to read about the Plane Crash my client lost his life: http://www.amarillonet.com/stories/031500/usn_LA0703.001.shtml, http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/672849.stmMy late client was an influential wealthy businessman, a Contractor in my Country and a Russian big time Oil dealer and the Principal owner of Oil Alliance Company and he left behind a deposit of Twenty Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollar ($25,500,000.00USD) in his domiciliary bank account in a commercial bank here in Ivory Coast. Which is one of the main reasons it has been very important to locate his next of kin.  After the death of my client his bankers contacted me, as his Attorney to provide his next of kin who should inherit his fortune. The board of directors of his bank adopted a resolution and I was mandated to provide his next of kin for the payment of this money or forfeit the money to the bank as an abandoned Estate. The bankers had planned to invoke a clause in the property Act, to confiscate the funds after the expiration of a period given to me. It was while i was searching for his family records on the internet that i came across your contact.I have searched through almost all the genealogy site that you can think of both in the Russia,USA and all the possible places I thought my clients would have possibly had a family member. Despairing and at the point of desperation, I came across your name, while trying to locate documentation's regarding possible relatives of my client in his country of origin. Convinced that you may be able to act in locus for my late client as his next of kin, I therefore, decided to contact you with these facts before me because of the status quo. By virtue of my brief and my closeness to the deceased, I am very much aware of my client's financial standing and the bank account he operates here in my country.  I have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client and the sole beneficiary of his estate, so that you are be paid the funds left in his bank account, hence I contacted you. I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin; the bank needs only the facts as presented legally. The rest is between you and I and with my guide we can have the money paid into your account, once this is done we shall both share the funds. 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% should be for Taxes as your Government may require, I shall assemble all the necessary Legal Documents that will be used to back up our claim. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any Breach of law. Please get in touch with me.Best Regards,Barrister  Philip WilsonDear friend,I am making this contact with you based on trust and confidence I have foryou, your Company and God irrespective of the fact that we have notmet before and because of the nature of the business I am about to introduceto you,I want to remain positive having the faith, the willand convincing myself that you will be interested and capable to do businesswith me.This business proposal I wish to intimate you with isof mutual benefit and its success is entirely based on mutualtrust,cooperation and a high levelof confidentiality as regard thistransaction.My name is Mr. Daniel Johnson The kind of the relationship andthe confidential nature makes it imperative for me to contact youdirectly by email.

In my department we discovered sum of $20million Us dollars(Twenty-million Us dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late MR.THOMPSON MORRIS Age 61 an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight261 which crashed on January- 31- 2000, including his wife and only daughter. Since we got information about his death,we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately I learned that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury asunclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money remained after five years the money will be transferred into banking treasury as unclaimed funds. We agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while the balance will be for my colleagues and I. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. Please be honest to me. Note this transaction is confidential and risk free. As soon as you receive this email you should contact me through my e-mail address. Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you as has been finalized. HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON. YOURS, LAWSON MNANDI.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;According to the Ghanaian Law, at the expiration of 7{Seven} years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Ghana Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>(1) I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>(2) We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your name for the transfer.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>(3) A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin of Mr.Barry Kelly.

Add photos, events, holidays, w=hatever.--0-1619350560-1138121517=:33811--  Dear Sir/Madam, I am the expert director heading Investments and Portfolio Management in the above-mentioned firm in Switerland. I am contacting you in view of an urgent assistance to carry out a pending transaction, which will develop a cordial business relationship between you and me. One of my clients whom I have personally managed his portfolio for 10 years now was a victim of a fatal car crash. His name is Late Mr Saud Ed Abad AlKharj, he was survived by a fiance and a two-year-old son from her as they intended getting married but where trying to be cautious because of Islamic law attitude on adultery. This were his only family and no next of kin, as he was the only child of Late Sheikh Hamza Al Kharj Al Faisal, who received royalties from the Kuwaiti Government on one of his fields which oil was discovered and subsequently explored (the Al Jazriah Oil Field). All subsequent investigation to find a next of kin was privately conducted by me and was futile. It was at this juncture that I and other officials Managing his portfolio and 2 bank managers where he had his accounts now decided to make this proposal and transfer ownership of the portfolio to an Agreeing party as beneficiary to the portfolio of the deceased. The reason why ownership cannot be transferred to his wife to be and only son is that Islamic law will not recognize such and if an attempt is made on that it may put her in trouble with the authorities for giving birth outside marriage. So we have decided to help her by making this proposal and making sure she gets a substantial part of Late Mr Saud AlkharjÃ¯Â¿Â½s property for her and her son. You must be asking where I got your mail address, it was made available to me by a junior director Mrs Cynthia Philips in charge of customer services on request for contacts for investment expansion for a client but she is not aware of this contact. All records and accounts regarding the assets of deceased were managed by me for 10 years running, if you are interested to assist us, all I will do is to incorporate in the old records recognizing you as the only beneficiary. The banking law here stipulates that if such portfolio remains unclaimed after four years it will go to the public department. The need for a foreigner as beneficiary is occasioned by the fact that the deceased was not permanently resident in Switzerland. For your assistance, we made up of I, 2 senior directors in my firm and 2 bank managers in banks which the Kuwaiti Government pay royalties, accruing to the deceased have agreed in fairness to make available 25% of all bank funds cleared and 15% of the royalties which you will continue to receive on behalf of the deceased as sole beneficiary every year.

ICONTACT YOU BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NOT LET ME DOWNONCE THE FUND GOES INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. Let me hear from you urgently byEmail<EJIS_DON55@YAHOO.CO.IN>Best Regards Mr EJIS DON,From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,          Johannesburg,South Africa.My Dear ,Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an!d confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugab!e's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.Best Regards, Mr.Michael Kamah and family. =C2=A0Regards,=20Mr.Adnan Harmoudi Ismailttp://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtmlhttp:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm=20=C2=A0=C2=A0He is an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM=20=CORPORATION, Mr. Donald Heck, made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months,= valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars= only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved=20=to my present position recently.

I am married to Mr. Hassan Mohamed who worked with Liberian embassy in Lome-Togo for Ten years before he died in the year 2002.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief  illness that lasted for only four days.Before his death we were both born again Moslim. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my  matrimonial home which the Quran is against. When my late husband was  alive he deposited the sum of $6.8Million (Six Million Eight hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one security company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to keep this fund in Europe. I want an organization or an individual that will use this fund for orphanages, idows,propagating the word of Allah and to endeavor that the house of Allah is maintained. The Holy Quran made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision  because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Moslim and I don't want my husbands efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the  bosom of the Almighty Allah .I don't need any telephone  Communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With Allah all things are possible.  As soon as I receive your reply I shall inform the security company in Europe that you are the beneficiary of the said consignment you will need to go and claim this fund in Europe. I will also issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the organization to always pray for me  because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Moslim. Whoever that wants to serve the Allah must serve  him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your  life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person  for this same  purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.

As you read this, don't feel sorry for me, because it is the destiny of everyman to die someday. I am Jaron Abbas an Israeli by birth and a business merchant based in Scotland. I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer.It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I regret that I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself), but my trade. Though I am very well to do, I was never open handed; I was always hostile to people and regarded them like they never had hopes of becoming as successful as myself. Now I know that there is a lot more to life than just prosperity.I believe that when I am given a second chance to come to this world, I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that death is imminent, I have willed and given most of my belongings to immediate and extended family members, as well as a few close friends. I want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul. Hence I have decided to support charity work; this is what I want to be remembered for. So far, I have been able to reach out to a few charity organizations in the Singapore, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.I once asked members of my family to aid me in giving of alms to those organizations catering for the less privileged in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the resources to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contempt with what I have left for them.The last of my belonging which no one knows of, is the huge deposit of Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand US dollars that I have in a safe keeping company abroad, which I will want you to secure and bestow to charity organizations.You can reach me on my email address jaron_abbass@yahoo.deJaron AbbasDEAR FRIEND,THROUGH THE COURTESY OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, I TAKE LIBERTY ANCHORED ON ASTRONG DESIRE TO SOLICIT YOUR ASSISTANCE ON THIS MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL ANDRISKFREE TRANSACTION WHICH I HOPE YOU WILL GIVE YOUR URGENT ATTENTION.I AM MR.SESAY MASSAQUOE  I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER ,THIS WAS INCONFIDENCE CONSIDERING OUR PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION.I ESCAPED WITH MY WIFE AND CHILDREN  OUT OF SIERRA- LEONE TOGROU-JIRNSSUM,A VILLAGE IN THE NETHERLANDS THROUGH THE AID OF THE UNITEDNATIONS EVACUATION TEAM WHERE WE ARE NOW PRESENTLY RESIDING  ON TEMPORARYPOLITICAL ASYLUM.HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION I DECIDED TO CHANGE MOST OF MY BILLIONS OFDOLLARS DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER FORMS OFMONEY CODED FOR SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW HEAD OF STATES  AHMED TEJANKABBA MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEANCOUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY TREASURES DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEANCOUNTRIES,HENCE I AND MY WIFE  ALONG WITH MY CHILDREN, DECIDED LAYING LOWIN THIS OUR TEMPOERY POLITICAL ASYLUM CAMP HERE IN GROU JIRNSSUM IN THENETHERLANDS TO STUDY THE SITUATION TILL WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,SINCEPRESIDENT TEJAN KABBA TAKING OVER GOVERNMENT AGAIN IN SIERRA-LEONE ONE OFMY  CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED BY THE FRENCHGOVERNMENT,AND AS SUCH WE HAD TO CHANGE OUR IDENTITY SO THAT OURINVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND CONFISCATED.I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM OF THIRTY MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITEDSTATES DOLLARS(US$30,500,000)WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING.THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM KNOWING THE ACTUALCONTENTS.WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO NOW IS TO INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILLASSIST ME AND MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR BEHALF.THE ACCOUNT REQUIRED FOR THIS PROJECT CAN EITHER BE PERSONAL,COMPANY OR ANOFFSHORE ACCOUNT THAT YOU HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER,YOUR AREA OFSPECIALISATION WILL NOT BE A HINDERANCE TO THE SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OFTHIS TRANSACTION.ACKOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE,SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY FAMILY AS OURFOREIGN TRUSTED PARTNER WHO SHALL TAKE CHARGE OF OUR INVESTMENT ABROADWHERE WE NOW PLAN TO SETTLE.I WANT YOU TO ASSIST US IN INVESTING THIS MONEY,BUT I WILL NOT WANT OURIDENTITY REVEALED.I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCKS INMULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND NON SPECULATIVEINVESTMENTS.WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF HEALTH AND SPIRITUAL TURMOIL,HENCE WILL NEEDYOUR UNDERSTANDING AND ASSISTANCE.MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALLITY WHICHTHIS BUSINESS DEMANDS AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST ANDCONFIDENCE WHICH WE REPOSE IN YOU.I SHALL PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE OF THISBUSINESS,I.E TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING MAINTAINED ANDALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES.I SHALL INFORM YOU WITH  THE NEXT LINE OF ACTION AS SOON AS I RECEIVE YOURPOSITIVE RESPONSE.IS THIS PROPOSITION ATTAINABLE?IF IT IS,PLEASE KINDLY FURNISH MEIMMEDIATELY BY E-MAIL WITH YOUR DIRECT TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS TOENHANCE THE CONFIDENTIALLITY WHICH THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS.BEST REGARDSMR.SESAY MASSAQUOE.REPLY TO MY PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS ...........>semassaq1@primposta.hu______________________________________________________ June 20th is Father's Day.

BURKINA FASO ANNEX.I hope this meets you in good health, My name is Dr Dinka Dogon the  manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of  African development bank , Burkina Faso Annex here in Ouagadougou, west  africa.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Twenty-two Million United   States Dollar US$22m dollars in an account, belonging to one of our customer  Eng. Christian Eich ,Who died alongside with his entire family on Monday,  31 July, 2000 in a plane crash in paris.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next  of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learntthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the   plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I and my colleagues decided to make   this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of  kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since   nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank  treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after seven years, the money will be transfered into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a  Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to your designated bank account ,you must apply first to the bank as a relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of application that we will send to you, so we  will like you to send to us your private telephone , fax number  for easy and effective communication and location where the moneywill be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, we will send to you by fax or email the text of  the application . we will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You shouldcontact us immediately as soon as you receive this letter.Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours faithfully.Dr Dinka DogonBill & Exchange Manager,AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B.BF ANNEX )_________________________________________________________________DÃ¯Â¿Â½couvrez le Blog heroic Fantaisy d'Eragon! http://eragon-heroic-fantasy.spaces.live.com/ Good day Sir=2C I am so sorry for sending you this unsolicited and unexpected mail=2E I got your contact from a Business directory in my agents office and I decided to contact you directly for the sake of business=2E My full Name is Francis Williams=2EI am searching for a reliable and experience business partner=2E I have about $4=2E3 Million Dollars with me and I would want to develop it and then invest it here in U=2EA=2EE or Europe under your guidance=2E So I am only soliciting for your assistance to help me develop the currency=2E My Business is totally free of risk and trouble=2EIf you are willing to invest in this business please give me your confidential contact phone number so that we can see face to face and discuss in details=2E Thank you once again for your interest and waiting for your reply=2E Best Regards=2C Francis Williams=2C I would like to apply through this medium for your co-operation and to secure an opportunity to invest and do joint business with you in your country,as i do not have much knowleagde about international business/investment.I have a substantial capital I honorably intend to invest in your countryinto a very lucrative venture of which you are to advise and execute thesaid venture over there for the mutual benefits of both of us.

This =is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address =so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that =will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of =the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of =probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

Due to the land andpolitical problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of PresidentRobert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform whollyaffecting the rich white farmers and the few rich blackfarmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, myfather for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe.Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our businessforeign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares inmajor companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA to depositthe sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundredthousand US dollars), in a private security company. Thismoney was deposited with this Private Security company forsafety and security reasons, and was to be used for thepurchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishmentof new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the violentZimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to themurder of my beloved father and other innocent lives.I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance frommy father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, butwhen the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murderattempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in theHolland where I am seeking political asylum. In fact mydecision to come here to seek asylum, is because the securitycompany from South Africa, has a branch holland and theyhave moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down here.I need to transfer this money to an account and invest partof the money.

The Government has also considered the impact of the importation of some food items like Rice, Beans, Frozen Chicken and Turkeys and other food stuffs on the Nations Foreign Reserve and have banned the importation of the items that could be produced locally. As a  result, the ederal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources has been mandated to import Agricultural Equipments for supply to Local Farmers both at SUBSISTENT AND COMMERCIAL level to encourage them to produce enough food items for local consumption and for export to other African Countries.

I have confidence that you have the ability to execute this business to our benefit and believe that you will not let down the trust and confidence I am willing to repose in you.     I attended a Business seminar here in CÃ¯Â¿Â½te d'Ivoire, While in this seminar, I was lucky to meet Alhaji Fofanah the owner of one of the largest Agricultural Firm dealing on Life stock ets. Alhaji Fofanah is an accomplished agriculturist who specialise in cattle farms and various other agricultural product for export. He has farm in different countries of West Africa. But above all he is one of the greatest suppliers of cattle, beef and other dairy products in this part of the world. Due to my relationship with Alhaji Fofanah and on getting to know my profession, Alhaji Fofanah took me into confidence by informing me about huge amount of money he spends on the purchase of a particular and very important medicine for his cattle.      He informed me that he buys this product at the rate of $5,000.00USD per carton, and that he mostly buys to the excess of 300 cartons. He informed me that he was only asking me to find out if I can also source for him a cheaper supplier considering the recent trend of falls in the general price of beef in the world market which is affecting his business.     I discussed this business with someone here and he decided to handle the supply by himself. We carried out a market research and discovered that we could purchase this cattle medicine somewhere cheaper in Europe for $ 3,000.00 USD per carton. We moved to Alhaji Fofanah to make a supply to him at $ 4,800.00 USD per Carton of which he accepted.      Owing to my role in the Whole arrangement, I had an agreement with the man to be receiving 18% of whatever gain is made on each Supply since he is to finance the transaction of which he agreed. But on the 20th August 2005, when the first supply of 120 cartons were made to the Alhaji Fofanah ,The man decided to renegade on our agreement. He refused to give me anything near the agreement we arrived at but gave me only what he termed an offer of appreciation. I decided to overlook this betrayal but since then our relationship has seized to be cordial. He never said anything to me again about Alhaji Fofanah.     But recently, I visited Alhaji Fofanah he is requesting for supplies of 250 cartons of these substances following a suspected out break of disease among his cattle in Mali and Guinea. He has requested that these supplies be made before the mid August 2006. I convinced him that I can arrange for an international supplier who can supply him at the price of $ 4,600.00 USD per Carton. But that he Alhaji Fofanah or his representative will have to go to Europe and inspect it before lifting the goods. At the moment Alhaji Fofanah is waiting for me or my foreign contact.     If you can handle this project, please contact me immediately for details on how to go about it and the negotiation on what is to be my commission. I am ready to give you Alhaji's contact for your direct conversation with him on the mode of payment method.<DIV><FONT face=3Dsystem></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=3Dsystem></=FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=3Dsystem>Dearest one, </FONT></DIV>  <=DIV><FONT face=3Dsystem>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grace and peace be multiplied =unto you.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=3Dsystem>I know my mail might be =a surprise to you&nbsp;but never mind&nbsp;because I am contacting you in= good faith.</FONT><FONT face=3Dsystem>&nbsp;There are certain times in o=ne=92s life<BR>that whether or not one indicates interest for certain ass=ignment,<BR>people would look&nbsp;up to&nbsp;him/her for assistance. </F=ONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=3DSystem>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm Miss Naomi st=ephane, a 23year old ophan&nbsp;from the Republic of Zimbabwe. </FONT></D=IV>  <DIV><FONT face=3DSystem>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the current crisi=s against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the supporters of President Robert M=ugabe to claim all the<BR>white owned farms in our country, he ordered al=l the white farmers to<BR>surrender their farms to his party members and their followers.<BR>My father however was one of the b=est farmers in the country, hence the supporters invaded my father's farm= and burnt down everything, killed him and confiscated his properties (i'=ve earlier lost my mom in my teen).

On the 2nd of January 2005, I received a call that one of my customer died in the Tsunami Disaster with his wife and only child while on vacation at Phuket Island in Thailand. Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of my customer's extended relatives and until date have not succeeded.    I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my client before it gets confiscated by our bank or declared unserviceable by our bank where this deposit is lodged. Now, the bank Directors has called a board meeting regarding this Fund. So my main motive right now is to share this great opportunity with you by presenting you as the Next of Kin to the Deceased since all his banking details are with me as his personal Account Officer. And the deceased Account valued at US$17.5MSince I have been unsuccessful in locating the biological relatives of my late client, I hereby seek your consent to present you to the bank as next-of-kin of the deceased since you are a foreigner, so that the proceeds of this account valued at  US$17.5M can be transferred to you as inheritance and thereafter, you and I can share the money; 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% will be donated to the Tsunami Disaster Charity Fund.    We shall start the first transfer with US$5,000.000.00 (Five Million United States Dollars only), upon the successful actualization of the first transfer without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account. I have the original copy of Certificate of Deposit of the funds, which will be used to substantiate our inheritance claims. All I require is your consent and honest co-operation to enable us see the deal through. Furthermore, I guarantee that the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

This isnecessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependableand trustworthy foreign partner. This request may seemstrange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgenceand pray that you take my request very serious.I amMr. Joseph Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J.F. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12other Liberian Government officials was assassinatedas a result of a military coup that toppled thegovernment of President William R. Tolbert, Jr. Mayhis soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my familyhas always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia.You can view our family web page below; (http://www.chessonfamily.com/chessonfamilypage.htm)but please do not call me on the tel/fax number below as the number is presumedbugged by the government.I received information from a reliable source thatdescribed your country as being economically conducivefor investment and her people as transparent andtrustworthy to engaging business, which made me towrite you. As you may want to know and to make youless curious, I got your email address from anInternet site that portrayed you in good light. Early this year, Liberia rebels agitated for theremoval ofPresident Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very goodexample of a bad leader. The President who neededsupport from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sumof twenty-eight million United States Dollars (US$28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as compensationfor my late father and solicited for my support. Iquickly made an arrangement with a courier companyhere in Monrovia and moved the consignment to an assetmanagement company in the uk. I did not supportPresident Charles Taylor because my conscience is notfor sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up inLiberia, he placed all the eligible members of myfamily under travel watch,confiscated all ourtraveling documents and frozen all our account inLiberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberiaand different peace keeping meetings were held andPresident Taylor was advised to step down for nationalpeace. On the 11th August 2003 President CharlesTaylor flied into exile but the problem we are havingnow is that he handed over power to his Vice-PresidentMoses Blah who is more wicked and dangerous. He wasthe person that instigated Taylor to confiscated allour traveling documents and frozen all our account inLiberia. That is why I requested for your sincereassistance pending when a fresh election will be heldhere. The main rebel faction Liberians United forReconciliation and Democracy (LURD) has vowed tocontinue its war if Taylor hands over to Blah. Therebels are not happy with the above development sothey still continued fighting. WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO FOR US:I will transfer theownership of the consignment /boxes containing thecash to you and issue you a power of attorney throughmy Lawyer. With these document you will lay claims tothe money as my proxy from the company in europe.The entire operation is risk free since it is only youand me and my Lawyer that knows the details of themoney after you must have taken the money to yourcountry where it is save my lawyer will then meet youin your country to use my share of the money forinvestment. Bearing in mind that your assistance isneeded to transfer this fund, I propose a commissionof 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you forthe expected services and assistance. Your private faxand telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedyconclusion of this transaction (our only hope in lifenow) urgently. Your urgent response via the aboveemail address is highly needed so as to stop furthercontact. I must use this opportunity to implore you toexercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matterextra ordinarily confidential whatever your decisionwhile I await your prompt response. Our phone lineboth home and abroad are bugged. So donÃ¯Â¿Â½t call me. Iwill always call you at my convenient time and in aconducive atmosphere.

My husband was named one of the ten Outstanding Young Men in Public Administration. He was also named Most Outstanding Mayor and Foremost Nationalist and Most Outstanding Metro Manila Mayor. My husband is recently accused of illegal acquire some four Billion Peso ($80M) during his 31 months in office as President backed up by an uprising of mass Demonstrators and Senate Traitors. They also said that he has skimmed off tobacco excise Taxes benefitting from government business deals.Most of them benefitted from my husband's generousity when he was in office. But they just turned around to be the ones to impeach him. I have tried every possible means to get him out of Detention without success. The Despotic forces in power appear bent in deriding him, rubbishing his achievements while freezing all his known Bank accounts.He has been accused of economic plunder carrying the maximum penalty of death. To the worst of it all,all other wives of my husband especailly Guia Gomez and some of his children born outside wedlock are testifying against us.In conjunction with the PCGG funded by the recent President Arroyo Macapagal Gloria. These are some of the allegations file! before my husband in the impeachment trial; 1. Gov.

On Dec 31 Five synchronized bomb attacks kill 22 people and injure more than 120 in Manila, days before the trial is to return from holiday recess. Police accuse Muslim rebels but many fear the bombs may be linked to the trial. 4. That my husband received about $8.5 million in pay-offs from illegal gambling operators. 5. That my husband participated in a real estate business controlled by me and my son Jose despite a prohibition on outside business interests while in office. My husband is suffering from bronchitis and emphysema right now and he detained at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City in hospital prison outside Manila where the life of my husband is in danger.I will let you know that it is political motivated by Gloria Arroyo.Meanwhile,the government has said that it may drop rebellion charges against my husband allies Senator Juan Ponce Enrile and the former ambassador to the United State Ernesto Maceda because they were in the side of my husband,both men were later jailed by the government of Gloria Arroyo that they instigated a march on the presidential palace by 50,000 supporters of my husband.These are all political.All these are done to have my husband death.
