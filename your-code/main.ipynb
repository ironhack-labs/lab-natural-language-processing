All the necessary documents for the deposit are in my possession I am now a refugee in neigbouring african country Ghana due to the fear of been killed by president charles taylor and the unrest in Liberia.Ironically the president of Nigeria  has agreed to grant  president charlestaylor assylum in Nigeria inorder to restore peace in liberia so we are trying to do all  we can atearnest to retrieve the funds fromthe security company and leave West Africa before he eventually comes toNigeria.Upon your response to this mail,i will intimate you on how we can proceedto get the funds from the security company.Best regards,Joseph</td>\n",

       "5962  Goodday,I am Joseph vaye,the son of late Issac Nuhan Vaye, deputy minister of publicworks under President charles taylor of Liberia.Before the political upheaval in liberia my late father was a good andclose friend of presidentcharles taylor and a member of his inner caucus.But of late when liberiacrisis came up again,with the rebels trying to oust charles taylor outof government and liberia,president charles taylor became very uncomfortablewith some of his loyalists which my late father happened to be one of thembecause he had the believe that at the rate at which the rebel group was closing in on him in Monrovia(which is the seat of power)was as a resultof the leakage of some vital security information  from his cabinet and hedecided to eliminate some of his cabinet members which my father happenedto be a victim.It started in the name of an uncovered coup and he ordered the arrest ofsome of his cabinet ministersand the Vice President Moses Blah on the 5th of june which my father wasincluded and some days later we learnt about my father's death alongsidewith John Winpoe Yormie, deputy minister of national security.My mother and i actually knew why my father was murdered because beforethe political mayhem inliberia,my late father  and President charles taylor have maintained agood relationship and he hasassisted him in lodging funds from the sales of diamond in different banksand security companies which my late father also benefited from it untilat the wake of rebellious war in liberia my father was not getting along withPresident Charles taylor because of his tyranic law which created a breachin their relationship and with the alarming rate at which the rebels areadvancing into Monrovia to unseat President charles taylor he was no longersure of  some of his cabinet members and decided to eliminatethem under the disguise that they were coup plottersBefore the death of my father, at the peak of his relationship with president charles taylor,he was ableto accumulate some funds $31,600,000.00 (US$31.6million)which he depositedwith a security company in Ghana from the deals he did for the president.Basically my mother and i require a trustworthy person that can assistus to retrieve our funds from thesecurity company in Ghana.Life has been very unstable for us(my mum,myyoungers ones and i) and i would not want to bore you with all we wentthrough but for the sake of my late fathers death. All the necessary documents for the deposit are in my possession I am now a refugee in neigbouring african country Ghana due to the fear of been killed by president charles taylor and the unrest in Liberia.Ironically the president of Nigeria  has agreed to grant  president charlestaylor assylum in Nigeria inorder to restore peace in liberia so we are trying to do all  we can atearnest to retrieve the funds fromthe security company and leave West Africa before he eventually comes toNigeria.Upon your response to this mail,i will intimate you on how we can proceedto get the funds from the security company.Best regards,Joseph   \n",

OLUMNISTSJVlartin Wolf Obama was too cautious in fearful times By Martin Wolf Published: AuÃ¢ÂÂ¢ ust 31 2010 22:48 j Last updated: August 31 2010 22:48Suppose that the US presidential election of 1932 had in fact taken place in 1930 at an early stage in the Great Depression. Suppose too that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had won then though not by the landslide of 1932. Howdifferent subsequent events might have been. The president might have watched helplessly as output and employmentcollapsed. The decades of Democratic dominance might not have happened. On such chances the wheel of history turns. But this time was different: the crisis brought Barack Obama to power closeto the beginning of the economic collapse. I (among others) then argued that policy needed to be hugely aggressive. Alasit was not. I noted on February 4 2009 at the beginning of the new presidency: \"Instead of an overwhelming fiscalstimulus what is emerging is too small too wasteful and too ill-focused.\" A week later I asked: \"Has Barack Obama'spresidency already failed? In normal times this would be a ludicrous question. But these are not normal times. They aretimes of great danger. Today the new US administration can disown responsibility for its inheritance; tomorrow it will ownit. Today it can offer solutions; tomorrow it will have become the problem. Today it is in control of events; tomorrowevents will take control of it. Doing too little is now far riskier than doing too much.\" This was right. The direction of policy was not wrong: policymakers Ã¢ÂÂ though not all economists Ã¢ÂÂ had learnt a great deal from the 1930s. Sensible people knew that aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion was needed together with reconstruction of thefinancial sector. But as Larry Summers Mr Obama's chief economic adviser had said: \"When markets overshoot policymakers mustovershoot too\". Unfortunately the administration failed to follow his excellent advice. This has allowed opponents to claimthat policy has been ineffective when it has merely been inadequate. In consequence the administration has lost credibility with the public and the chances of a renewed fiscal expansion havedisappeared. With the Federal Reserve cautious too the likelihood of a lengthy period of weak growth and heavyjoblessness is high. So too are the chances of domestic and global political friction. True the idea that the policies adopted in the last few months of the Bush administration and the first months of this onewere far better than nothing is weirdly controversial in the US. A recent paper by Alan Blinder former vice-chairman of the Fed and Mark Zandi of Moody's argues that such critics are wrong. They use a standard macro-economic model toassess what would have happened without any intervention without the financial interventions (including monetary policy)and without the fiscal action. They conclude that the peak to trough decline in gross domestic product would have beenclose to 12 per cent with no policy response compared to an actual decline of just 4 per cent (see chart). Similarly theunemployment rate would have peaked at 16.5 per cent instead of the actual 10 per cent. The bigger collapse would alsohave meant a fiscal deficit of $2600bn in fiscal year 2011. The outcome is also disastrous with the modest fiscal responsebut no financial Ã¢ÂÂ¢olic resÃ¢ÂÂ¢onse. It is a little better the other way round. The implication that the modest stimulus package of February 2009 Ã¢ÂÂ a mere 5.7 per cent of 2009 GDP spread overseveral years Ã¢ÂÂ made a positive contribution is supported by the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office: it arguesthat in 2010 US GDP will be between 1.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent higher and the unemployment rate between 0.7 and1.8 percentage points lower as a result of the package. Panglossians who believe the private economy is always in equilibrium unless governments intervene disagree. I wishthere were some way to run this experiment without hurting hundreds of millions of people. But I find the idea that allowingthe collapse of much of the financial system avoiding unconventional monetary policy and struggling to close the fiscaldeficit would have been consistent with a more rapid and sustained recovery quite bizarre. A fascinating perspective does come however from comparisons with what happened in other advanced countries. Therecession in US output (and so demand) has been relatively small but the decline in employment has been exceptionallylarge as a result of an extraordinary surge in US productivity (see charts). This contrast between what would happen tooutput and what would happen to employment was missed in the initial Congressional Budget Office analysis of thestimulus. Since the US was the epicentre of the financial crisis the relatively small decline in output is remarkable. Moreover sincefiscal and monetary stimuli bear directly on demand and output not jobs this is a policy success. At the same time theenthusiasm with which US managers laid off workers is also extraordinary. No doubt some of this is due to the collapse inconstruction. But some of it must be due to the ease with which US companies can lay off workers and the incentives formanagers to maintain profits in a downturn at the expense of jobs. Debate is emerging on how much of the surge in unemployment is structural. My answer from European experience isthat one way to ensure it becomes structural is to let it linger. In the short run the simplest way to prevent that fromhappening is to expand demand and so output. Since there is huge slack in the labour market not the slightest threat ofinflation Ã¢ÂÂ far more a risk of deflation Ã¢ÂÂ and no constraint from bond or foreign exchange markets on further monetary andfiscal stimulus these are the policies that have to be pursued. Yet alas the Fed seems to have decided to fall asleep andthe administration has lost the initiative. So what is going to happen? I assume that after the midterm elections resurgent Republicans will offer new tax cuts andignore the fiscal deficits. They will pretend that this has nothing to do with any reviled stimulus though it is much the samething Ã¢ÂÂ increasing fiscal deficits thereby offsetting private frugality. That would put the administration on the spot. It wouldhave to choose between vetoing the tax cuts and accepting them so allowing the Republicans to get the credit for their\"yacht and mansion-led\" recovery. Any recovery is better than none. But it could have been much better than this. Thosewho were cautious when they should have been bold will pay a big price.martin.wolf@ft.com More columns at www.ft.com/martinwolf Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2010.

       "text      Financial Times FTcomr OLUMNISTSJVlartin Wolf Obama was too cautious in fearful times By Martin Wolf Published Au ust     Last updated August   Suppose that the US presidential election of  had in fact taken place in  at an early stage in the Great Depression Suppose too that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had won then though not by the landslide of  Howdifferent subsequent events might have been The president might have watched helplessly as output and employmentcollapsed The decades of Democratic dominance might not have happened On such chances the wheel of history turns But this time was different the crisis brought Barack Obama to power closeto the beginning of the economic collapse  among others then argued that policy needed to be hugely aggressive Alasit was not  noted on February   at the beginning of the new presidency Instead of an overwhelming fiscalstimulus what is emerging is too small too wasteful and too illfocused  week later  asked Has Barack Obamaspresidency already failed In normal times this would be  ludicrous question But these are not normal times They aretimes of great danger Today the new US administration can disown responsibility for its inheritance tomorrow it will ownit Today it can offer solutions tomorrow it will have become the problem Today it is in control of events tomorrowevents will take control of it Doing too little is now far riskier than doing too much This was right The direction of policy was not wrong policymakers  though not all economists  had learnt  great deal from the s Sensible people knew that aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion was needed together with reconstruction of thefinancial sector But as Larry Summers Mr Obama chief economic adviser had said When markets overshoot policymakers mustovershoot too Unfortunately the administration failed to follow his excellent advice This has allowed opponents to claimthat policy has been ineffective when it has merely been inadequate In consequence the administration has lost credibility with the public and the chances of  renewed fiscal expansion havedisappeared With the Federal Reserve cautious too the likelihood of  lengthy period of weak growth and heavyjoblessness is high So too are the chances of domestic and global political friction True the idea that the policies adopted in the last few months of the Bush administration and the first months of this onewere far better than nothing is weirdly controversial in the US  recent paper by Alan Blinder former vicechairman of the Fed and Mark Zandi of Moody argues that such critics are wrong They use  standard macroeconomic model toassess what would have happened without any intervention without the financial interventions including monetary policyand without the fiscal action They conclude that the peak to trough decline in gross domestic product would have beenclose to  per cent with no policy response compared to an actual decline of just  per cent see chart Similarly theunemployment rate would have peaked at  per cent instead of the actual  per cent The bigger collapse would alsohave meant  fiscal deficit of bn in fiscal year  The outcome is also disastrous with the modest fiscal responsebut no financial olic resonse It is  little better the other way round The implication that the modest stimulus package of February    mere  per cent of  GDP spread overseveral years  made  positive contribution is supported by the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office it arguesthat in  US GDP will be between  per cent and  per cent higher and the unemployment rate between  and percentage points lower as  result of the package Panglossians who believe the private economy is always in equilibrium unless governments intervene disagree  wishthere were some way to run this experiment without hurting hundreds of millions of people But  find the idea that allowingthe collapse of much of the financial system avoiding unconventional monetary policy and struggling to close the fiscaldeficit would have been consistent with  more rapid and sustained recovery quite bizarre  fascinating perspective does come however from comparisons with what happened in other advanced countries Therecession in US output and so demand has been relatively small but the decline in employment has been exceptionallylarge as  result of an extraordinary surge in US productivity see charts This contrast between what would happen tooutput and what would happen to employment was missed in the initial Congressional Budget Office analysis of thestimulus Since the US was the epicentre of the financial crisis the relatively small decline in output is remarkable Moreover sincefiscal and monetary stimuli bear directly on demand and output not jobs this is  policy success At the same time theenthusiasm with which US managers laid off workers is also extraordinary No doubt some of this is due to the collapse inconstruction But some of it must be due to the ease with which US companies can lay off workers and the incentives formanagers to maintain profits in  downturn at the expense of jobs Debate is emerging on how much of the surge in unemployment is structural My answer from European experience isthat one way to ensure it becomes structural is to let it linger In the short run the simplest way to prevent that fromhappening is to expand demand and so output Since there is huge slack in the labour market not the slightest threat ofinflation  far more  risk of deflation  and no constraint from bond or foreign exchange markets on further monetary andfiscal stimulus these are the policies that have to be pursued Yet alas the Fed seems to have decided to fall asleep andthe administration has lost the initiative So what is going to happen  assume that after the midterm elections resurgent Republicans will offer new tax cuts andignore the fiscal deficits They will pretend that this has nothing to do with any reviled stimulus though it is much the samething  increasing fiscal deficits thereby offsetting private frugality That would put the administration on the spot It wouldhave to choose between vetoing the tax cuts and accepting them so allowing the Republicans to get the credit for theiryacht and mansionled recovery Any recovery is better than none But it could have been much better than this Thosewho were cautious when they should have been bold will pay  big price More columns at wwwftcommartinwolf Copyright The Financial Times Limited  Print  single copy of this article for personal use Contact us if

Suppose too that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had won then though not by the landslide of 1932. Howdifferent subsequent events might have been. The president might have watched helplessly as output and employmentcollapsed. The decades of Democratic dominance might not have happened.On such chances the wheel of history turns. But this time was different: the crisis brought Barack Obama to power closeto the beginning of the economic collapse. I (among others) then argued that policy needed to be hugely aggressive. Alasit was not. I noted on February 4 2009 at the beginning of the new presidency: \"Instead of an overwhelming fiscalstimulus what is emerging is too small too wasteful and too ill-focused.\" A week later I asked: \"Has Barack Obama'spresidency already failed? In normal times this would be a ludicrous question. But these are not normal times. They aretimes of great danger. Today the new US administration can disown responsibility for its inheritance; tomorrow it will ownit. Today it can offer solutions; tomorrow it will have become the problem. Today it is in control of events; tomorrowevents will take control of it. Doing too little is now far riskier than doing too much.\" This was right.The direction of policy was not wrong: policymakers Ã¢ÂÂ though not all economists Ã¢ÂÂ had learnt a great deal from the 1930s.Sensible people knew that aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion was needed together with reconstruction of thefinancial sector.But as Larry Summers Mr Obama's chief economic adviser had said: \"When markets overshoot policymakers mustovershoot too\". Unfortunately the administration failed to follow his excellent advice. This has allowed opponents to claimthat policy has been ineffective when it has merely been inadequate.In consequence the administration has lost credibility with the public and the chances of a renewed fiscal expansion havedisappeared. With the Federal Reserve cautious too the likelihood of a lengthy period of weak growth and heavyjoblessness is high. So too are the chances of domestic and global political friction.True the idea that the policies adopted in the last few months of the Bush administration and the first months of this onewere far better than nothing is weirdly controversial in the US. A recent paper by Alan Blinder former vice-chairman of theFed and Mark Zandi of Moody's argues that such critics are wrong. They use a standard macro-economic model toassess what would have happened without any intervention without the financial interventions (including monetary policy)and without the fiscal action. They conclude that the peak to trough decline in gross domestic product would have beenclose to 12 per cent with no policy response compared to an actual decline of just 4 per cent (see chart). Similarly theunemployment rate would have peaked at 16.5 per cent instead of the actual 10 per cent. The bigger collapse would alsohave meant a fiscal deficit of $2600bn in fiscal year 2011. The outcome is also disastrous with the modest fiscal responsebut no financial Ã¢ÂÂ¢olic resÃ¢ÂÂ¢onse. It is a little better the other way round.The implication that the modest stimulus package of February 2009 Ã¢ÂÂ a mere 5.7 per cent of 2009 GDP spread overseveral years Ã¢ÂÂ made a positive contribution is supported by the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office: it arguesthat in 2010 US GDP will be between 1.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent higher and the unemployment rate between 0.7 and1.8 percentage points lower as a result of the package.Panglossians who believe the private economy is always in equilibrium unless governments intervene disagree. I wishthere were some way to run this experiment without hurting hundreds of millions of people. But I find the idea that allowingthe collapse of much of the financial system avoiding unconventional monetary policy and struggling to close the fiscaldeficit would have been consistent with a more rapid and sustained recovery quite bizarre.A fascinating perspective does come however from comparisons with what happened in other advanced countries. Therecession in US output (and so demand) has been relatively small but the decline in employment has been exceptionallylarge as a result of an extraordinary surge in US productivity (see charts). This contrast between what would happen tooutput and what would happen to employment was missed in the initial Congressional Budget Office analysis of thestimulus.Since the US was the epicentre of the financial crisis the relatively small decline in output is remarkable. Moreover sincefiscal and monetary stimuli bear directly on demand and output not jobs this is a policy success. At the same time theenthusiasm with which US managers laid off workers is also extraordinary. No doubt some of this is due to the collapse inconstruction. But some of it must be due to the ease with which US companies can lay off workers and the incentives formanagers to maintain profits in a downturn at the expense of jobs.Debate is emerging on how much of the surge in unemployment is structural. My answer from European experience isthat one way to ensure it becomes structural is to let it linger. In the short run the simplest way to prevent that fromhappening is to expand demand and so output. Since there is huge slack in the labour market not the slightest threat ofinflation Ã¢ÂÂ far more a risk of deflation Ã¢ÂÂ and no constraint from bond or foreign exchange markets on further monetary andfiscal stimulus these are the policies that have to be pursued. Yet alas the Fed seems to have decided to fall asleep andthe administration has lost the initiative.So what is going to happen? I assume that after the midterm elections resurgent Republicans will offer new tax cuts andignore the fiscal deficits. They will pretend that this has nothing to do with any reviled stimulus though it is much the samething Ã¢ÂÂ increasing fiscal deficits thereby offsetting private frugality. That would put the administration on the spot. It wouldhave to choose between vetoing the tax cuts and accepting them so allowing the Republicans to get the credit for their\"yacht and mansion-led\" recovery. Any recovery is better than none. But it could have been much better than this.

had in fact taken place in at an early stage in the Great Depression Suppose too that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had won then though not by the landslide of Howdifferent subsequent events might have been The president might have watched helplessly as output and employmentcollapsed The decades of Democratic dominance might not have happened On such chances the wheel of history turns But this time was different the crisis brought Barack Obama to power closeto the beginning of the economic collapse among others then argued that policy needed to be hugely aggressive Alasit was not noted on February at the beginning of the new presidency Instead of an overwhelming fiscalstimulus what is emerging is too small too wasteful and too illfocused week later asked Has Barack Obamaspresidency already failed In normal times this would be ludicrous question But these are not normal times They aretimes of great danger Today the new US administration can disown responsibility for its inheritance tomorrow it will ownit Today it can offer solutions tomorrow it will have become the problem Today it is in control of events tomorrowevents will take control of it Doing too little is now far riskier than doing too much This was right The direction of policy was not wrong policymakers though not all economists had learnt great deal from the s Sensible people knew that aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion was needed together with reconstruction of thefinancial sector But as Larry Summers Mr Obama chief economic adviser had said When markets overshoot policymakers mustovershoot too Unfortunately the administration failed to follow his excellent advice This has allowed opponents to claimthat policy has been ineffective when it has merely been inadequate In consequence the administration has lost credibility with the public and the chances of renewed fiscal expansion havedisappeared With the Federal Reserve cautious too the likelihood of lengthy period of weak growth and heavyjoblessness is high So too are the chances of domestic and global political friction True the idea that the policies adopted in the last few months of the Bush administration and the first months of this onewere far better than nothing is weirdly controversial in the US recent paper by Alan Blinder former vicechairman of the Fed and Mark Zandi of Moody argues that such critics are wrong They use standard macroeconomic model toassess what would have happened without any intervention without the financial interventions including monetary policyand without the fiscal action They conclude that the peak to trough decline in gross domestic product would have beenclose to per cent with no policy response compared to an actual decline of just per cent see chart Similarly theunemployment rate would have peaked at per cent instead of the actual per cent The bigger collapse would alsohave meant fiscal deficit of bn in fiscal year The outcome is also disastrous with the modest fiscal responsebut no financial olic resonse It is little better the other way round The implication that the modest stimulus package of February mere per cent of GDP spread overseveral years made positive contribution is supported by the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office it arguesthat in US GDP will be between per cent and per cent higher and the unemployment rate between and percentage points lower as result of the package Panglossians who believe the private economy is always in equilibrium unless governments intervene disagree wishthere were some way to run this experiment without hurting hundreds of millions of people But find the idea that allowingthe collapse of much of the financial system avoiding unconventional monetary policy and struggling to close the fiscaldeficit would have been consistent with more rapid and sustained recovery quite bizarre fascinating perspective does come however from comparisons with what happened in other advanced countries Therecession in US output and so demand has been relatively small but the decline in employment has been exceptionallylarge as result of an extraordinary surge in US productivity see charts This contrast between what would happen tooutput and what would happen to employment was missed in the initial Congressional Budget Office analysis of thestimulus Since the US was the epicentre of the financial crisis the relatively small decline in output is remarkable Moreover sincefiscal and monetary stimuli bear directly on demand and output not jobs this is policy success At the same time theenthusiasm with which US managers laid off workers is also extraordinary No doubt some of this is due to the collapse inconstruction But some of it must be due to the ease with which US companies can lay off workers and the incentives formanagers to maintain profits in downturn at the expense of jobs Debate is emerging on how much of the surge in unemployment is structural My answer from European experience isthat one way to ensure it becomes structural is to let it linger In the short run the simplest way to prevent that fromhappening is to expand demand and so output Since there is huge slack in the labour market not the slightest threat ofinflation far more risk of deflation and no constraint from bond or foreign exchange markets on further monetary andfiscal stimulus these are the policies that have to be pursued Yet alas the Fed seems to have decided to fall asleep andthe administration has lost the initiative So what is going to happen assume that after the midterm elections resurgent Republicans will offer new tax cuts andignore the fiscal deficits They will pretend that this has nothing to do with any reviled stimulus though it is much the samething increasing fiscal deficits thereby offsetting private frugality That would put the administration on the spot It wouldhave to choose between vetoing the tax cuts and accepting them so allowing the Republicans to get the credit for theiryacht and mansionled recovery Any recovery is better than none But it could have been much better than this Thosewho were cautious when they should have been bold will pay big
