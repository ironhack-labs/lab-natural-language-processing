"Dear Sir/Madam,With a very desperate need for assistance, I have summed up courage to contact you.I am  presently working in Iraq with American troop, I found your contact particulars in an address journal.I am seeking your assistance to evacuate the sum of $17,000,000:00 (Seventeen million dollars) to your country or any other safe country of your choice, as far as I can be assured that my share will be safe in your care untill I complete my service here,this is no stolen money, and there are no dangers involved.SOURCE OF MONEY. Some money in American currency was discovered concealed in barrels with piles of weapons and ammunitions at a location near one of Saddam's old palaces during a rescue operation, and it was agreed by all party present that the money be shared amongst us, this was quite an illegal thing to do, but I tell you what? no compensation can make up for the risks we have taken with our lives in this hell hole. The abovefigure ! was given to me as my share, and to conceal this kind of money became a problem for me, so with the help of a German contact working here, and his office enjoys some immunity, I was able to get the package out to a safe location entirely out of trouble spot.The German contact does not know the real contents of the package, and beleives that it belongs to an Asian American who died in an air raid, and before giving up, trusted me to hand over the package to his business associate.I have now found a secured way of getting the package out to a safer country in Europe for you to pick up, and will discuss this with you when I am sure that you are willing to assist me.One passionate appeal I will make to you is not to discuss this matter with a third party, should you have reasons to reject this offer, please destroy this mail as any leakage of this information will be too bad for us. I do not know for how long we will remain here, and I havesurvived 2 suicide bomb attacks by the special grace of God, this and other reasons I will mention later has prompted me to reach out for help, I honestly want this matter to be resolved immediately.Please contact me through my email so we can discuss more.Respectfully,Adams AllenN/B PLEASE FORWARD ALL CORRESPONDENCE TO adamsiniraq@myway.com ",1

"Pleas Send your reply to this email address; (abbahnasser002@yahoo.it) Hello my dear,Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. I am Director of Procurement Department at the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, here in the United Arab Emirates.  I obtained your email while searching for a reliable person, who could assist me in receiving transfer of a supposed contract awarded funds.  This fund came as a result of over estimated contract awarded sums executed by foreign contractors in the Petroleum Ministry. This fund has been approved for payment to the contractor by the concerned Ministry. The contracts had been executed and commissioned. What I am about to receive now, is the over estimated funds which the contractor whom I helped during the process of obtaining the contracts added to his estimation for my own interest.  This is a normal deal that goes in my Ministry by top officials. On our part, all modalities has been worked out in ensuring a smooth conclusion of the transfer to your account within the next few days.  All I want from you is to receive this funds on my behalf, because as Government Official I cannot collect the funds directly from the contractor, neither I am allowed by Law to operate/ run foreign bank accounts. If you are trustworthy and can assist me in receiving the fund, do not hesitate to respond back to me immediately.Please note that there is no risk involved in receiving the funds in your account for and it will be done through wire transfer. I wish you to state in percentage what you shall have for the use of your account.  As soon as you indicate your interest, further details and the amount involved shall be given to you once I hear from you.  Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. Looking forward to hearing from you soonest.Best regards,Engr. Abbah Nasser.Ministry of Petroleum and Ministry Resources.United Arab Emirates.",1

"Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you,so that the money can be  release to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody will come for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed dormant fund.The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed dormant fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe like me  can not stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me.Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin to the deceased customer with a text of application that i will send to you,but before i send to you the text of application form,I will like you to send me the following informations.1.

"Reply to this email :( faith.dorman@jubii.dk)Dearest in the Lord,=20PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.I am the above named p=erson from Guinea Bissau. I am married to Dr Oputa Dorman who worked with= Guinea Bissau Embassy in South Africa for nine years before he died in t=he year 2000. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died a=fter a brief illness that lasted for only four days.Before his death we were both born again Christians and we lived happily.= Since his death, I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my mat=rimonial home which the Bible is really against. When my late husband was= alive he secured $15Million (Fifteen Million U.S. Dollars) with a Vault =Company here in Cote d=92Ivoire. Presently, this money is still with the =Vault Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that from the entire test cond=ucted on my health, I am not going to last long, especially, due to my ca=ncer and stroke. But what disturbs me most now is stroke. Having known my= condition, I decided to donate this fund to churches or Christian indivi=dual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct. I want =a church or individual that will use this money to fund churches, Orphana=ges and Widows.Also, the propagation of the work of God, building and maintaining the ho=use of God through this money, is very important. The Bible made us to un=derstand that Blessed is the hand that gives. I took this decision becaus=e I don=92t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband re=latives are not Christians. I don=92t want my husbands hard earned money =to be misused by unbelievers, for their own selfish interest and in an un=godly manner. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I k=now that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says= that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace.=20I don=92t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my h=ealth, and because of the presence of my husbands relatives around me som=etimes. I don=92t want them to know about this development, but I know th=at With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I sh=all give you the contact of the Vault Company in Cote D' Ivory. I will al=so give you all information regarding the deposit of this money, and issu=e you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original- benefi=ciary of this fund. Meanwhile, I will want you and your church to always =pray for me because God work in mysterious ways. My happiness is that I l=ived a life of a worthy Christian. Who ever that wants to serve the Lord =must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all throug=h your life.Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or Chr=istian individual for this same purpose.

" ATTN:DIRECTOR/C E O, I know you will be surprised to read from me, but pleaseconsider this as a request from a family i dire need ofassistance.First, I must introduc myself. I a MR. BALOYSITHOLE. from Angola. I am the first and only son ofBRIGADIER SITHOLE JONES. I am presently resident in SouthAfrica.I got your contact address from a business directory inJohannesburg Chamber of commerce and Industry. On behalf ofmy widowed mother MRS. ELIZABETH SITHOLE, I desided tosolicit for your assistance to transfer the sum of US$21.5MILLION( TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITEDSTATES DOLLARS)inherited from my late father, into yourpersonal/ company's account.Before my fathers' death, he was a Brigadier in charge ofArms and Ammunation procurement for the Angola Army. In hisWILL, he specifically drew my attentionto the said sum of money which he deposited in a safe boxof a private Security Company in Johannesburg- South Africain a treasure box, fully documented in myname. IN FACT MY FATHER SAID AND I QUOTE 'MY BELOVED SON, I WISHTO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO US$21.5 MILLION . I DEPOSITED THEBOX CONTAINING THIS MONEY IN A SECURITY COMPANY INJOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA. DURING THE WAR, I WAS VERYDEDICATED AND OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES WEREBUSSY HELPING THEMSELVES WITH GOVERNMENT FUNDS ANDPROPERTIES AND SENDING THEM TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES. DUE TOTHIS, WHEN I AND MY FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENTWERE ASSIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT (EDUARDO SANTOS) TO PURCHASEARMS IN SOUTH AFRICA, WE SAW THIS AS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITYAND DIVERTED THE MONEY AND DIVIDED IT. i GOT A TOTAL SUM OFUS$21.5 MILLION. IN CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH, AS ARESULT OF DEATH ONLY, YOU SHOULD SOLICIT FOR THE FUND FORINVESTMENT PURPOSES.'>From the above, you will understand that the lives andfuture of my family depens on this money, as such I will begrateful if you can assist us. We are now living in SouthAfrica as political Asylum seekers and financial laws andregulation of the Republic of South Africa do not permit usfinancial rights to such huge sum of money. In view ofthis, I cannot invest this fund in South africa, hence i amprepared to offer you 20% of the total fund, while 10% willbe set aside for local and international expenses and 70%will be for my family and me.Finally, modalities on howthe transfer will be bone will beconveyed to you once we have established trust andconfidence between ourselves.

"FROM THE DESK OF MASSAN AHMEDBILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.Dear Sir,              I am the manager of bill and exchange foreign remittance at the department of Bank Of Africa (BOA).In my departmentn we discovered an abandone sum of $ 22.6 m US dollars (Twenty two  Millon six hundred thousand  US dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in a concord plane crash in the year 2000 in paris that almost took the whole life of the pasengeres on board.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this  businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don;t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after ten years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for ;me and my colleagues.Thereafter I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement accoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.   Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.

"The IndependentNovember 12 2009sbwhoeopThursday November 12 2009 8:52 AMHFYI: Murdoch makes his move to Cameron. Attack on BBC to follow. SidHas Cameron done a deal with Murdoch?By Andy McSmithLord Mandelson's attack shines spotlight on Tory leader'slinks with media mogulDavid Cameron has been accused of making a ""contract"" with Britain's biggest media company to trade political supportbefore an election for government favours afterwards if the Tories win.The accusation was levelled yesterday by the Business Secretary Peter Mandelson who is increasingly the public face ofGordon Brown's government. Ministers are angry at the campaign that The Sun has run against the Prime Minister all thisweek over the spelling mistakes in a letter Mr Brown sent to the mother of a young soldier killed in Afghanistan.They suspect that the Conservative Party has been tailoring its policies on media regulation and the BBC to suit thecommercial interests of News International which owns The Sun and that the paper's aggressive support for the Tories isa pay-off that could spread to other parts of the mass media.Examples of the apparent tie-in between what News International's boss James Murdoch wants and what DavidCameron is ready to promise include the recent decision by the Conservatives to abandon the idea of ""top slicing"" theBBC licence fee. It had been proposed that part of the money paid to the BBC would be siphoned off to help regionaltelevision companies meet the threat from the internet. But this would also have helped them compete more effectivelyagainst Sky News which is part of the Murdoch media empire.When the policy was abandoned in September Jeremy Hunt the shadow Culture Secretary said that it was becauseenacting it might make the commercial television companies ""focus not on attracting viewers but on attracting subsidies"".There was no gain for the BBC in the climbdown because David Cameron had already said that the Tories will freeze thelicence fee. What it will mean is that the BBC's income will be capped without the regional television companies seeingany government help which will strengthen the market position of Britain's only satellite television company Sky. ""Thiswas done for News International"" a Tory insider said yesterday. ""Murdoch wants Sky to go head to head with the BBC.He doesn't want the independent companies strengthened.""In April 2008 James Murdoch complained bitterly about the media regulator Ofcom in his first major speech after takingover as chief executive of News Corporation in Europe and Asia. The following year David Cameron announced that aConservative government would cut Ofcom down to size.Last summer James Murdoch attacked the ""abysmal record"" of the BBC Trust - the body created by Labour to over seethe BBC - in a lecture he gave at the Edinburgh Festival singling out its ""total failure"" to stop the BBC buying the LonelyPlanet travel guides a takeover that Murdoch denounced as an ""egregious"" invasion of private enterprise by the state.Less than two months later Jeremy Hunt promised that the Tories would abolish the Trust.In the same lecture Murdoch complained that BBC performers like Jonathan Ross are being paid salaries that ""nocommercial competitor can afford"". He had barely uttered the words before Ed Vaizey a shadow media ministerpromised that a Tory government would compel the BBC to publish the salaries of its top performers.Lord Mandelson alleged yesterday that the Conservatives and News International had ""effectively formed a contract overthe head incidentally of the newspaper's editor and their readers in which they are sort of bound to one another"".Speaking to the BBC's Today programme he added: ""What The Sun can do for the Conservatives during the election isone part of the contract and presumably what the Conservatives can do for News International if they are elected is theother side of the bargain. But there is a wider question. When The Sun creates the news in this way this is then followedup by Sky News which then puts pressure on the BBC to follow suit.""This was ""absolutely categorically"" denied yesterday by The Sun's political editor Tom Newton Dunn who accused LordMandelson of talking ""preposterous nonsense"".The Sun which supported Labour through three general elections under Tony Blair's leadership announced that it wasjumping ship on the day that Gordon Brown delivered his annual speech to the Labour Party conference in September.Its onslaught on Gordon Brown for the mistakes made in a handwritten letter to Jacqui Janes is the most aggressiveattack that the newspaper has directed at any Labour Party leader since Neil Kinnock stood down after losing the 1992general election a defeat for which The Sun claimed victory with the slogan ""It was The Sun wot won it"".But there were signs yesterday that the attack may have rebounded on The Sun. Mr Brown who is blind in one eye hasadmitted that his handwriting is bad and has apologised to Mrs Janes whose 20-year-old son Jamie was killed by amakeshift bomb in Afghanistan last month.A poll yesterday for the website PoliticsHome whose main shareholder is the Conservative Party deputy chairman LordAshcroft found that 65 per cent of those polled thought that The Sun's attack was ""inappropriate"" compared with 23 percent who thought it was ""legitimate"".The closeness of the new Tory-Sun axis is shown up by the revelation from an inside source that David Cameronpersonally consulted the editor of The Sun Dominic Mohan in three separate conversations before he abandoned his""cast-iron"" promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty now that all 27 members states of the EU have ratified it.Mr Cameron was understandably wary of how The Sun might react to the abandonment of that promise. The paper hascampaigned for years against what it sees as the growth of an EU superstate. It was in an open letter to readers of TheSun that Cameron first made his guarantee two years ago.His announcement that a referendum is off the agenda was subjected to a scathing attack in'the Daily Mail but in TheSun it was given kid-glove treatment under the headline ""Cameron's crusade for UK rights"".The person behind this aggressively pro-Tory policy is James Murdoch not his father Rupert who created The Sunvirtually from scratch in the 1970s. Rupert Murdoch claimed in an interview with Sky News Australia that he ""regretted"" hisson's decision to turn against Gordon Brown ""who is a friend of mine"" but defended it on the grounds that Brown hasbeen a ""disappointment"".Yesterday The Times another Murdoch newspaper announced that its veteran political editor Phil Webster is leavingthe Commons where he has been based for decades. Mr Webster is very well thought of by New Labour. Hisreplacement Roland Watson was a friend of David Cameron's at Eton but has no political ties with the Tories.Tom Newton Dunn newly appointed as The Sun's political editor is another Old Etonian. His father Bill used to be aTory MEP but defected to the Liberal Democrats in 2000.Independent News and Media Limited",1

"America's Faltering Search for Peace in the Middle East: Openings for Others?Remarks to staff of the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairsand separately to members of the Norwegian Institute of International AffairsAmbassador Chas W. Freeman Jr. (USFS Ret.)1 September 2010 Oslo NorwayYou have asked me to speak to current American policies in the Middle East with an emphasis on the prospects forpeace in the Holy Land. You have further suggested that I touch on the relationship of the Gulf Arabs especially SaudiArabia to this. It is both an honor and a challenge to address this subject in this capital / at this ministry.The declaration of principles worked out in Oslo seventeen years ago was the last direct negotiation between Israelis andPalestinian Arabs to reach consequential positive results. The Oslo accords were a real step toward peace not anotherdeceptive pseudo-event in an endlessly unproductive so-called ""peace process."" And if that one step forward in Oslo in1993 was followed by several steps backwards there is a great deal to be learned from how and why that happened.There can be no doubt about the importance of today's topic. The ongoing conflict in the Holy Land increasingly disturbsthe world's conscience as well as its tranquility. The Israel-Palestine issue began as a struggle in the context of Europeancolonialism. In the post-colonial era tension between Israelis and the Palestinians they dispossessed became bydegrees the principal source of radicalization and instability in the Arab East and then the Arab world as a whole. Itstimulated escalating terrorism against Israelis at home and their allies abroad. Since the end of the Cold War theinteraction between Israel and its captive Palestinian population has emerged as the fountainhead of global strife. It isincreasingly difficult to distinguish this strife from a war of religions or a conflict of civilizations.For better or ill my own country the United States has played and continues to play the key international part in thiscontest. American policies more than those of any other external actor have the capacity to stoke or stifle the hatreds inthe Middle East and to spread or reverse their infection of the wider world. American policies and actions in the MiddleEast thus affect much more than that region.Yet as I will argue the United States has been obsessed with process rather than substance. It has failed to involveparties who are essential to peace. It has acted on Israel's behalf to preempt rather than enlist international and regionalsupport for peace. It has defined the issues in ways that preclude rather than promote progress. Its concept of a ""peaceprocess"" has therefore become the handmaiden of Israeli expansionism rather than a driver for peace. There arealternatives to tomorrow's diplomatic peace pageant on the Potomac. And as Norway has shown there is a role forpowers other than America in crafting peace in the Holy Land.Over thirty years ago at Camp David Jimmy Carter pushed Israel through the door to peace that Egypt's Anwar Sadathad opened. Twenty years ago the first Bush administration pressed Israel to the negotiating table with Palestinianleaders setting the stage for their clandestine meetings in Oslo. The capacity of the United States to rally othergovernments behind a cause that it espouses may have atrophied but American power remains far greater than that ofany other nation. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East.For more than four decades Israel has been able to rely on aid from the United States to dominate its region militarily andto sustain its economic prosperity. It has counted on its leverage in American politics to block the application ofinternational law and to protect itself from the political repercussions of its policies and actions. Unquestioning Americansupport has enabled Israel to put the seizure of ever more land ahead of the achievement of a modus vivendi with thePalestinians or other Arabs. Neither violent resistance from the dispossessed nor objections from abroad have broughtsuccessive Israeli governments to question let alone alter the priority they assign to land over peace.Ironically Palestinians too have developed a dependency relationship with America. This has locked them into a politicalframework over which Israel exercises decisive influence. They have been powerless to end occupation pogroms ethniccleansing and other humiliations by Jewish soldiers and settlers. Nor have they been able to prevent their progressiveconfinement in checkpoint-encircled ghettos on the West Bank and the great open-air prison of Gaza.Despite this appalling record of failure the American monopoly on the management of the search for peace in Palestineremains unchallenged. Since the end of the Cold War Russia ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ once a contender for countervailing influence in theregion ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ has lapsed into impotence. The former colonial powers of the European Union having earlier laid the basis forconflict in the region have largely sat on their hands while ringing them content to let America take the lead. ChinaIndia and other Asian powers have prudently kept their political and military distance. In the region itself Iran haspostured and exploited the Palestinian cause without doing anything to advance it. Until recently Turkey remained aloof.On rare occasions as in the case of the 1973 Arab oil embargo the Arabs have backed their verbal opposition to Israelwith action. Egypt and Jordan have settled into an unpopular coexistence with Israel that is now sustained only by U.S.subventions. Saudi Arabia has twice taken the initiative to offer Israel diplomatic concessions if it were to concludearrangements for peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians. But overall Arab governments have earned the contemptof the Palestinians and their own people for their lack of serious engagement. For the most part Arab leaders havetimorously demanded that America solve the Israel-Palestine problem for them while obsequiously courting Americanprotection against Israel each other Iran and ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ in some cases ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ their own increasingly frustrated and angry subjects andcitizens.Islam charges rulers with the duty to defend the faithful and to uphold justice. It demands that they embodyrighteousness. The resentment of mostly Muslim Arabs at their governing elites' failure to meet these standardsgenerates sympathy for terrorism directed not just at Israel but at both the United States and Arab governmentsassociated with it.The perpetrators of the September 11 2001 terrorist attack on the United States saw it in part as reprisal for Americancomplicity in Israeli cruelties to Palestinians and other Arabs. They justified it as a strike against Washington's protectionof Arab governments willing to overlook American contributions to Muslim suffering. Washington's response to the attackincluded suspending its efforts to make peace in the Holy Land as well as invading and occupying Afghanistan andIraq. All three actions inadvertently strengthened the terrorist case for further attacks on America and its allies. Thearmed struggle between Americans and Muslim radicals has already spilled over to Pakistan Yemen Somalia and othercountries. Authoritative voices in Israel now call for adding Iran to the list of countries at war with America. They areechoed by Zionist and neo-conservative spokesmen in the United StatesThe widening involvement of Americans in combat in Muslim lands has inflamed anti-American passions and catalyzed ametastasis of terrorism. It has caused a growing majority of the world's 1.6 billion Muslims to see the United States as amenace to their faith their way of life their homelands and their personal security. American populists and Europeanxenophobes have meanwhile undercut liberal and centrist Muslim arguments against the intolerance that empowersterrorism by equating terrorism and its extremist advocates with Islam and its followers. The current outburst of bigoteddemagoguery over the construction of an Islamic cultural center and mosque in New York is merely the most recentillustration of this. It suggests that the blatant racism and Islamophobia of contemporary Israeli politics is contagious. Itrules out the global alliances against religious extremists that are essential to encompass their political defeat.President Obama's inability to break this pattern must be an enormous personal disappointment to him. He came intooffice committed to crafting a new relationship with the Arab and Muslim worlds. His first interview with the internationalmedia was with Arab satellite television. He reached out publicly and privately to Iran. He addressed the Turkishparliament with persuasive empathy. He traveled to a great center of Islamic learning in Cairo to deliver a remarkablyeloquent message of conciliation to Muslims everywhere. He made it clear that he understood the centrality of injusticesin the Holy Land to Muslim estrangement from the West. He promised a responsible withdrawal from Iraq and a judiciousrecrafting of strategy in Afghanistan. Few doubt Mr. Obama's sincerity. Yet none of his initiatives has led to policychange anyone can detect let alone believe inIt is not for me to analyze or explain the wide gaps between rhetoric and achievement in the Obama Administration'sstewardship of so many aspects of my country's affairs. American voters will render their first formal verdict on this twomonths from tomorrow on the 2nd of November. The situation in the Holy Land Iraq Afghanistan and adjacent areas isonly part of what they will consider as they do so. But I do think it worthwhile briefly to examine some of the changes inthe situation that ensure that many policies that once helped us to get by in the Middle East will no longer do this.Let me begin with the ""peace process"" a hardy perennial of America's diplomatic repertoire that the ObamaAdministration will put back on public display tomorrow. In the Cold War the appearance of an earnest and ""even-handed"" American search for peace in the Holy Land was the price of U.S. access and influence in the Middle East. Itprovided political cover for conservative Arab governments to set aside their anger at American backing of Israel so as tostand with America and the Western bloc against Soviet Communism. It kept American relations with Israel and theArabs from becoming a zero-sum game. It mobilized domestic Jewish support for incumbent presidents. Of course therehasn't been an American-led ""peace process"" in the Middle East for at least a decade. Still the conceit of a ""peaceprocess"" became an essential political convenience for all concerned. No one could bear to admit that the ""peaceprocess"" had expired. It therefore lived on in phantom form.Even when there was no ""peace process"" the possibility of resurrecting one provided hope to the gullible cover to theguileful beguilement for the press an excuse for doing nothing to those gaining from the status quo and ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ last but farfrom least ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ lifetime employment for career ""peace processors."" The perpetual processing of peace without therequirement to produce it has been especially appreciated by Israeli leaders. It has enabled them to behave likemagicians riveting foreign attention on meaningless distractions as they systematically removed Palestinians from theirhomes settled half a million or more Jews in newly vacated areas of the occupied territories and annexed a wideningswath of land to a Jerusalem they insist belongs only to Israel.Palestinian leaders with legitimacy problems have also had reason to collaborate in the search for a ""peace process."" It'snot just that there has been no obviously better way to end their people's suffering. Playing ""peace process"" charadesjustifies the international patronage and Israeli backing these leaders need to retain their status in the occupiedterritories. It ensures that they have media access and high-level visiting rights in Washington. Meanwhile for Americanleaders engagement in some sort of Middle East ""peace process"" has been essential to credibility in the Arab and Islamicworlds as well as with the ever-generous American Jewish community. Polls show that most American Jews areimpatient for peace. Despite all the evidence to the contrary they are eager to believe in the willingness of thegovernment of Israel to trade land for it.Previous ""peace processes"" have exploited all these impulses. In practice however these diplomatic distractions haveserved to obscure Israeli actions and evasions that were more often prejudicial to peace than helpful in achievingit. Behind all the blather the rumble of bulldozers has never stopped. Given this history it has taken a year and a half ofrelentless effort by U.S. Special Envoy George Mitchell to persuade the parties even to meet directly to talk about talks asthey first did here in Oslo seventeen years ago. When the curtain goes up on the diplomatic show in Washingtontomorrow will the players put on a different skit? There are many reasons to doubt that they will.One is that the Obama administration has engaged the same aging impresarios who staged all the previously failed""peace processes"" to produce and direct this one with no agreed script. The last time these guys staged such an ill-prepared meeting at Camp David in 2000 it cost both heads of delegation Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat their politicalauthority. It led not to peace but to escalating violence. The parties are showing up this time to minimize PresidentObama's political embarrassment in advance of midterm elections in the United States not to address his agenda ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ stillless to address each other's agendas. These are indeed difficulties. But the problems with this latest ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ and possibly finalÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ iteration of the perpetually ineffectual ""peace process"" are more fundamental.The Likud Party charter flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan River and stipulatesthat: ""The Palestinians can run their lives freely in the framework of self-rule but not as an independent and sovereignstate."" This Israeli government is committed to that charter as well as to the Jewish holy war for land in Palestine. It hasno interest in trading land it covets for a peace that might thwart further territorial expansion. It considers itself unboundby the applicable UN resolutions agreements from past peace talks the ""Roadmap"" or the premise of the ""two-statesolution.""The Palestinians are desperate for the dignity and security that only the end of the Israeli occupation can provide. But theauthority of Palestinian negotiators to negotiate rests on their recognition by Israel and the United States not on theirstanding in the occupied territories Gaza or the Palestinian diaspora. Fatah is the ruling faction in part of Palestine. Itsauthority to govern was repudiated by voters in the last Palestinian elections. The Mahmoud Abbas administration retainspower by grace of the Israeli occupation authorities and the United States which prefer it to the government empoweredby the Palestinian people at the polls. Mr. Abbas's constitutional term of office has long since expired. He presides overa parliament whose most influential members are locked up in Israeli jails. It is not clear for whom he his faction or hisadministration can now speak.So the talks that begin tomorrow promise to be a case of the disinterested going through the motions of negotiating withthe mandate-less. The parties to these talks seek to mollify an America that has severely lessened internationalcredibility. The United States government had to borrow the modest reputations for objectivity of others ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the EU Russiaand the UN ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ to be able to convene this discussion. It will be held under the auspices of an American president who waspublicly humiliated by Israel's prime minister on the issue that is at the center of the Israel-Palestine dispute ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Israel'scontinuing seizure and colonization of Arab land.Vague promises of a Palestinian state within a year now waft through the air. But the ""peace process"" has alwayssneered at deadlines even much much firmer ones. A more definitive promise of an independent Palestine within a yearwas made at Annapolis three years ago. Analogous promises of Palestinian self-determination have preceded or resultedfrom previous meetings over the decades beginning with the Camp David accords of 1979. Many in this audience willrecall the five-year deadline fixed at Oslo. The talks about talks that begin tomorrow can yield concrete results only if theinternational community is prepared this time to insist on the one-year deadline put forward for recognizing a Palestinianstate. Even then there will be no peace unless long-neglected issues are addressed.Peace is a pattern of stability acceptable to those with the capacity to disturb it by violence. It is almost impossible toimpose. It cannot become a reality still less be sustained if those who must accept it are excluded from it. This realitydirects our attention to who is not at this gathering in Washington and what must be done to remedy the problems theseabsences create.Obviously the party that won the democratically expressed mandate of the Palestinian people to represent them ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ HamasÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ is not there. Yet there can be no peace without its buy-in. Egypt and Jordan have been invited as observers. Yet theyhave nothing to add to the separate peace agreements each long ago made with Israel. (Both these agreements wereexplicitly premised on grudging Israeli undertakings to accept Palestinian self-determination. The Jewish state quicklyfinessed both.) Activists from the Jewish diaspora disproportionately staff the American delegation. A failure to reconcileeither American Jews or the Palestine diaspora to peace would doom any accord. But the Palestinian diaspora will berepresented in Washington only in tenuous theory not in fact.Other Arabs including the Arab League and the author of its peace initiative Saudi Arabia will not be at the talkstomorrow. The reasons for this are both simple and complex. At one level they reflect both a conviction that this latestinstallment of the ""peace process"" is just another in a long series of public entertainments for the American electorate andalso a lack of confidence in the authenticity of the Palestinian delegation. At another level they result from the way theUnited States has defined the problems to be solved and the indifference to Arab interests and views this definitionevidences. Then too they reflect disconnects in political culture and negotiating style between Israelis Arabs andAmericans.To begin with neither Israel nor the conveners of this proposed new ""peace process"" have officially acknowledged orresponded to the Arab peace initiative of 2002. This offered normalization of relations with the Jewish state should Israelmake peace with the Palestinians. Instead the United States and the Quartet have seemed to pocket the Arab offerignore its precondition that Israelis come to terms with Palestinians and gone on to levy new demands.In this connection making Arab recognition of Israel's ""right to exist"" the central purpose of the ""peace process"" offendsArabs on many levels. In framing the issue this way Israel and the United States appear to be asking for something wellbeyond pragmatic accommodation of the reality of a Jewish state in the Middle East. To the Arabs Americans now seemto be insisting on Arab endorsement of the idea of the state of Israel the means by which that state was established andthe manner in which it has comported itself. Must Arabs really embrace Zionism before Israel can cease expansion andaccept peace?Arabs and Muslims familiar with European history can accept that European anti-Semitism justified the establishment of ahomeland for traumatized European Jews. But asking them even implicitly to agree that the forcible eviction ofPalestinian Arabs was a morally appropriate means to this end is both a nonstarter and seriously off-putting. So is askingthem to affirm that resistance to such displacement was and is sinful. Similarly the Arabs see the demand that theyrecognize a Jewish state with no fixed borders as a clever attempt to extract their endorsement of Israel's unilateralexpansion at Palestinian expense.The lack of appeal in this approach has been compounded by a longstanding American habit of treating Arab concernsabout Israel as a form of anti-Semitism and tuning them out. Instead of hearing out and addressing Arab views U.S.peace processors have repeatedly focused on soliciting Arab acts of kindness toward Israel. They argue that gestures ofacceptance can help Israelis overcome their Holocaust-inspired political neuroses and take risks for peace.Each time this notion of Arab diplomacy as psychotherapy for Israelis has been trotted out it has been met withincredulity. To most in the region it encapsulates the contrast between Washington's sympathy and solicitude for Israelisand its condescendingly exploitative view of Arabs. Some see it as a barely disguised appeal for a policy of appeasementof Israel. Still others suspect an attempt to construct a ""peace process"" in which Arabs begin to supply Israel with gifts ofcarrots so that Americans can continue to avoid applying sticks to it.The effort to encourage Arab generosity as an offset to American political pusillanimity vis-a-vis Israel is ludicrouslyunpersuasive. It has failed so many times that it should be obvious that it will not work. Yet it was a central element ofGeorge Mitchell's mandate for ""peace process"" diplomacy. And it appears to have resurfaced as part of the proposedfollow-up to tomorrow's meeting between the parties in Washington. It should be no puzzle why the Saudis and otherArabs could not be persuaded to join this gathering.As a last thought before turning to what must be done let me make a quick comment on a relevant cultural factor. Arabichas two quite different words that are both translated as ""negotiation"" making a distinction that doesn't exist in eitherEnglish or Hebrew. One word ""musaawama"" refers to the no-holds-barred bargaining process that takes place inbazaars between strangers who may never see each other again and who therefore feel no obligation not to scam eachother. Another ""mufaawadhat"" describes the dignified formal discussions about matters of honor and high principle thattake place on a basis of mutual respect and equality between statesmen who seek a continuing relationship.Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of statesmanship to initiate a process ofmufaawadhat ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ relationship-building between leaders and their polities. So was the Arab peace initiative of 2002. Itcalled for a response in kind. The West muttered approvingly but did not act. After a while Israel responded withintermittent somewhat oblique suggestions of willingness to haggle over terms. But an offer to bicker over the terms onwhich a grand gesture has been granted is not surprisingly seen as insultingly unresponsive.I cite this not to suggest that non-Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of thought but to make a point about diplomaticeffectiveness. To move a negotiating partner in a desired direction one must understand how that partner understandsthings and help him to see a way forward that will bring him to an end he has been persuaded to want. One of thereasons we can't seem to move things as we desire in the Middle East is that we don't make much effort to understandhow others reason and how they rank their interests. In the case of the Israel-Palestine conundrum we Americans arelong on empathy and expertise about Israel and very very short on these for the various Arab parties. The essentialmilitarism of U.S. policies in the Middle East adds to our difficulties. We have become skilled at killing Arabs. We haveforgotten how to listen to them or persuade them.I am not myself an ""Arabist"" but I am old enough to remember when there were more than a few such people in theAmerican diplomatic service. These were officers who had devoted themselves to the cultivation of understanding andempathy with Arab leaders so as to be able to convince these leaders that it was in their own interest to do things we sawas in our interest. If we still have such people we are hiding them well; we are certainly not applying their skills in ourMiddle East diplomacy.This brings me to a few thoughts about the Western and Arab interests at stake in the Holy Land and their implications forwhat must be done.In foreign affairs interests are the measure of all things. My assumption is that Americans and Norwegians indeedEuropeans in general share common interests that require peace in the Holy Land. To my mind these interests include -but are of course not limited to ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ gaining security and acceptance for a democratic state of Israel; eliminating the grossinjustices and daily humiliations that foster Arab terrorism against Israel and its foreign allies and supporters as well asfriendly Arab regimes; and reversing the global spread of religious strife and prejudice including very likely a revival ofanti-Semitism in the West if current trends are not arrested. None of these aspirations can be fulfilled without an end tothe Israeli occupation and freedom for Palestinians.Arab states like Saudi Arabia also have compelling reasons to want relief from occupation as well as self-determinationfor Palestinians. They may not be concerned to preserve Israel's democracy as we are but they share an urgent interestin ending the radicalization of their own populations curbing the spread of Islamist terrorism and eliminating the tensionswith the West that the conflict in the Holy Land fuels. These are the concerns that have driven them to propose peace asthey very clearly did eight years ago. For related reasons Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has made inter-faith dialogueand the promotion of religious tolerance a main focus of his domestic and international policy.As the custodian of two of Islam's three sacred places of pilgrimage ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Mecca and Medina ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Saudi Arabia has longtranscended its own notorious religious narrow-mindedness to hold the holy places in its charge open to Muslims of allsects and persuasions. This experience joined with Islamic piety reinforces a Saudi insistence on the exemption ofreligious pilgrimage to Jerusalem from political interference or manipulation. The Ottoman Turks were careful to ensurefreedom of access for worship to adherents of the three Abrahamic faiths when they administered the city. It is an interestthat Jews Christians and Muslims share.There is in short far greater congruity between Western and Arab interests affecting the Israel-Palestine dispute than isgenerally recognized. This can be the basis for creative diplomacy. The fact that this has not occurred reflectspathologies of political life in the United States that paralyze the American diplomatic imagination. Tomorrow's meetingmay well demonstrate that the election of Barack Obama notwithstanding the United States is still unfit to manage theachievement of peace between Israel and the Arabs. If so it is in the American interest as well as everyone else's thatothers become the path-breakers enlisting the United States as best they can in support of what they achieve but notexpecting America to overcome its incapacity to lead.Here I think there is a lesson to be drawn from the Norwegian experience in the 1990s. The Clinton Administration washappy to organize the public relations for the Oslo accords but did not take ownership of them. It did little to protect themfrom subversion and overthrow and nothing to insist on their implementation. Only a peace process that is protectedfrom Israel's ability to manipulate American politics can succeed.This brings me to how Europeans and Arabs might work together to realize the objectives both share with mostAmericans: establishing internationally recognized borders for Israel securing freedom for the Palestinians and endingthe stimulus to terrorism in the region and beyond it that strife in the Holy Land entails. I have only four suggestions topresent today. I expect that more ideas will emerge from the discussion period. A serious effort to cooperate with theArabs of the sort that Norway is uniquely capable of contriving could lead to the development of still more options for jointor parallel action on behalf of peace.Now to my suggestions presented in ascending order of difficulty from the least to the most controversial.First get behind the Arab peace initiative. Saudi Arab culture frowns on self-promotion and the Kingdom is less giftedthan most at public diplomacy. Political factors inhibit official Arab access to the Israeli press. The Israeli media havepublished some ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ mostly dismissive ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ commentary on the Arab peace initiative but left most Israelis ignorant of itscontents and unfamiliar with its text. Why not buy space in the Israeli media to give Israelis a chance to read the ArabLeague declaration and consider the opportunities it presents? I suspect the Saudis as well as other members of theArab League would consider it constructive for an outside party to do this. It might facilitate other sorts of cooperationwith them in which European capabilities can also compensate for Arab reticence. The Turks and other non-ArabMuslims should be brought in as full participants in any such efforts. This wouldn't be bad for Europe's relations withboth. By the way given the U.S. media's notorious one-sidedness and American ignorance about the Arab peace plan awell-targeted advertising campaign in the United States might not be a bad idea either.Second help create a Palestinian partner for peace. There can be no peace with Israel unless there are officials whoare empowered by the Palestinian people to negotiate and ratify it. Israel has worked hard to divide the Palestinians soas to consolidate its conquest of their homeland. Saudi Arabia has several times sought to create a Palestinian peacepartner for Israel by bringing Fatah Hamas and other factions together. On each occasion Israel with U.S. support hasacted to preclude this. Active organization of non-American Western support for diplomacy aimed at restoring a unitygovernment to the Palestinian Authority could make a big difference. The Obama Administration would be under strongdomestic political pressure to join Israel in blocking a joint European-Arab effort to accomplish this. Under somecircumstances however it might welcome being put to this test.Third reaffirm and enforce international law. The UN Security Council is charged with enforcing the rule of lawinternationally. In the case of the Middle East however the Council's position at the apex of the international system hasserved to erode and subvert the ideal of a rule-bound international order. Almost forty American vetoes have preventedthe application to the Israeli occupying authorities of the Geneva Conventions the Nuremberg precedents human rightsconventions and relevant Security Council directives. American diplomacy on behalf of the Jewish state has silenced thecollective voice of the international community as Israel has illegally colonized and annexed broad swaths of occupiedterritory administered collective punishment to a captive people assassinated their political leaders massacred civiliansbarred UN investigators defied mandatory Security Council resolutions and otherwise engaged in scofflaw behaviorusually with only the flimsiest of legally irrelevant excuses.If ethnic cleansing settlement activity and the like are not just ""unhelpful"" but illegal the international community shouldfind a way to say so even if the UN Security Council cannot. Otherwise the most valuable legacy of Atlantic civilization -its vision of the rule of law ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ will be lost. When one side to a dispute is routinely exempted from principles all exemptthemselves and the law of the jungle prevails. The international community needs collectively to affirm that Israel bothas occupier and as regional military hegemon is legally accountable internationally for its actions. If the UN GeneralAssembly cannot ""unite for peace"" to do what an incapacitated Security Council cannot member states should not shrinkfrom working in conference outside the UN framework. All sides in the murder and mayhem in the Holy Land and beyondneed to understand that they are not above the law. If this message is firmly delivered and enforced there will be a betterchance for peace.Fourth set a deadline linked to an ultimatum. Accept that the United States will frustrate any attempt by the UNSecurity Council to address the continuing impasse between Israel and the Palestinians. Organize a global conferenceoutside the UN system to coordinate a decision to inform the parties to the dispute that if they cannot reach agreement ina year one of two solutions will be imposed. Schedule a follow-up conference for a year later. The second conferencewould consider whether to recommend universal recognition of a Palestinian state in the area beyond Israel's 1967borders or recognition of Israel's achievement of de jure as well as de facto sovereignty throughout Palestine (requiringIsrael to grant all governed by it citizenship and equal rights at pain of international sanctions boycott anddisinvestment). Either formula would force the parties to make a serious effort to strike a deal or to face theconsequences of their recalcitrance. Either formula could be implemented directly by the states members of theinternational community. Admittedly any serious deadline would provoke a political crisis in Israel and lead to diplomaticconfrontation with the United States as well as Israel despite the Obama Administration itself having proclaimed a one-year deadline in order to entice the Palestinians to tomorrow's talks. Yet both Israel and the United States would benefitimmensely from peace with the Palestinians.Time is running out. The two-state solution may already have been overtaken by Israeli land grabs and settlementactivity. Another cycle of violence is likely in the offing. If so it will not be local or regional but global in its reach. Israel'sactions are delegitimizing and isolating it even as they multiply the numbers of those in the region and beyond who aredetermined to destroy it. Palestinian suffering is a reproach to all humanity that posturing alone cannot begin toalleviate. It has become a cancer on the Islamic body politic. It is infecting every extremity of the globe with the rageagainst injustice that incites terrorism.It is time to try new approaches. That is why the question of whether there is a basis for expanded diplomatic cooperationbetween Europeans and Arabs is such a timely one. And it is why I was pleased as well as honored to have been askedto set the stage for a discussion of this issue.",1

How ever, be rest assured  that it comes with the best of intentions.How ever,your address was courtesy of a business journal at the WORLD TRADE IN JOHANESBURG.   But after due considerationof your profile, I became aware and assured of your credibility of handling this trust and my future  career. Thus, my humble decision to solicit for your   understanding and cooperation as it will be beneficial to both of us.

At this present war against farmers in Zimbabwe, with the support of our President Robert Mugabe to claim allthe white owned farm lands to his members and followers.  My father is one of the best farmers in our country and because he did not support his ideas, his supporters invaded my fathers farm and burnt every thing in it, killing my father and made away witha lot of items in his farm.      After the death of my father, I,my youngest brothers and my Mother,decided to move out of the country to South Africa because our life was and still in danger as a result of the money  my father kept in hidden safe in my mother's house.The total amount of the safe is US$16.5M (SixteenMillion Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars).  Presently, here in South Africa we have succeeded to deposit the container with a security company as a family treasure, with out letting them to know actually what the content is all about .  Because of our refugeestatus here, and hard conditions we encounter which  didn't warrant us to any financial right not even tooperate an account and many other irrelivant  conditions,we decided to lay a contact with the Over sea firm that can assist us to move this fund out ofherefor an investment in his country.As such we solicit for your assistance by way of coming to Johannesburg, South Africa to help and open account with any of the commercial banks here for on ward transfer of this fund to your nominated Over sea bank account.  We have agreed to give you %30 (thirtypercent) of the total sum for your noble assistance,while the remaining will be for my family investmentin your country or any country you may advice.      Notethat this transaction is risk free and at the same time maintain its confidentiality. Please, kindly come back to me immediately you receive this mail, for further   clarifications.

I'm off to Seattle for a conf on development and women at Microsoft and mtgs with Gates etc.I wanted to tell you that for your trip to Russia we have an announcement for you to Gov of St Petersburg who is thehighest ranking female official in the Russian govt. When I saw her some months ago she went on at length about herrespect for you and her meeting with you when you were Senator (she also met you at the Rejkavik W conf in '98) Weare going to hold a US-Russia women leaders Summit in St P in aprik It is in response to what I heard over and overduring my trip earlier this year that there is a strong desire (and need) to engage with US. Women and the women'sissues have been mostly off the agenda since the days we made it such a priority in the 90's and there is considerablerecidivism. She should be happy about the proposed summit.Secondly when you meet with the Lithuanian FM this week he will invite you to the community of Democ ministerial(end for Lith presidency) and as part of it a women and democ. Conf that will mark 10 years since the last one that washeld in the continuum you started. There are so many different needs today.Have a good trip.,0

"I'm sorry I was not able to join last week's meeting on Haiti but I have calls into Anne Marie and Arturo to get an update.Once I get a better understanding of how we plan to move forward on a regional basis we will work on putting togethera comprehensive PD strategy to support our effortsIf you like the idea I can begin to trial balloon it with media execs in US and LA that I knowpersonally to gauge their reaction.Of course we can't rely on a psa campaign alone to sustain the effort so we will develop other PD strategies forengagement throughout the region which I will forward as they evolve.Let me know what you think. In the meantime I thought you might be interested in the report below (copy attached aswell) which outlines the results to date of our global media outreach initiative.Successfully Engaging Global MediaAbout the U.S. Role and International Cooperation in HaitiExamples of Post Efforts to DateEUROPEÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Reinforcing the Secretary's message U.S. Ambassador to France Rivkin engaged directlywith over 100 journalists in an event streamed live on-line by CNN where he highlightedU.S. assistance to Haiti and the cooperation of the US with France the UN and theinternational community. Embassy Paris also reached out to senior officials in the ElyseeMFA French media and civil society at all levels to underscore the message of positivecoordination with our French partners and to set the record straight on the work of the USGin Haiti. As a result leading French officials dismissed rumors of rising diplomatic tensionsbetween the two countries. Leading officials consistently praised the work of the Obamaadministration in Haiti and the need for a strong US role in the emergency response.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Embassy London's media blitz featured Ambassador Susman who underlined the U.S.commitment to Haiti at an Embassy Martin Luther King Jr. holiday event with actor JamesEarl Jones; the event was covered by BBC World News (audience 270 million worldwide)and various U.K. papers. The Ambassador and the JO also spoke about Haiti on January 20-22 on BBC TV 2's ""Daily Politics Show"" BBC Radio the BBC TV Evening News andother media and helped embed an ITV journalist on the USNS Comfort to help balance ITV'spreviously negative reporting and reached out personally to BBC producers to call attentionto inaccurate reporting alleging that the U.S. military prevented Medicins Sans Frontiersfrom delivering aid and supplies to the airport in Port Au Prince.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ With media coverage growing more critical U.S. Ambassador to Greece Speckhard gave aninterview to Ta Nea newspaper and DCM Deborah McCarthy who previously served inHaiti was interviewed by Real Sunday newspaper resulting in positive stories about U.S.assistance to Haiti. Meanwhile the PAO spoke with the Director of Elefterotypia whosepaper has run some of the most misdirected coverage of Haiti and received a commitment torun an Embassy-produced story to counteract the misinformation.AFRICAÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Four African posts ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Senegal Ghana Nigeria and Tanzania ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ organized highly successfuloutreach programs based on the diversion of the USS Gunston Hall to Haiti. The ship withAfrican officers aboard was headed to western Africa under AFRICOM' s AfricanPartnership Station maritime security training program when it was diverted to provide reliefto Haiti. With African officers working alongside U.S. military officers to deliver assistanceto Haitians PAOs at those posts connected local reporters with the ship to conduct liveinterviews of the Africans for their home media resulting in excellent media placement in allfour countries.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ On January 20 U.S. Ambassador to South Africa Gips gave a 10-minute live interview onHaiti with 5FM a leading youth station with listenership of approx 800000. TheAmbassador highlighted the depth and breadth of US support and congratulated South Africafor sending emergency teams. The radio hosts told the Embassy afterward that e-mails andSMS messages were pouring into the station in support of U.S. efforts. Ambassador Gipsreached out to additional audiences via broadcast media on January 21 and recorded aprogram via the Africa Regional Media Hub with SABC-International TV's ""RendezvousAfrica"" program (broadcast across the continent) and live interviews with drive-time radioprograms on two national stations.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ As a result of a press conference hosted by the Embassy on January 22 all major Angolanmedia gave positive coverage to U.S. efforts in Haiti including Radio Nacional de Angolaand the Jornal de Angola newspaper which ran an editorial January 23 that stated: ""We needto believe and let those on the ground do their work because the old tactics of criticizing whois doing something for the Haitian People just for the sake of criticizing at a moment like thisis not acceptable. . . Just see the numbers of daily flights that arrive in Haiti to have an ideaand quickly come to the conclusion that the possible failures and omissions do not supersedethe positive and timely work done by the entities undertaking the relief efforts in Haiti.""EAST ASIA-PACIFICÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ The U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia's January 21 byliner on Haiti ran as the lead item on theeditorial page of Sep utar Indonesia daily and it was subsequently picked up by Antara theIndonesian national news agency and subsequently appeared in most Indonesian media.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ South Korea: Looking to help Korean audiences connect with the situation in Haiti PASeoul arranged a Digital Video Conference with the U.S. Consul in Nagoya Japan who hadpreviously served as Information Officer in Port-au-Prince and was a fluent Koreanspeaker. CG Kwak underlined the long tradition of US humanitarian assistance to Haiti aswell as the massive US response to the current crisis and noted Korea's own activeinvolvement in the relief work. The U.S. Ambassador's blog on January 22 dedicated to theearthquake and those affected by it received more than 1500 hits in three days with almostall comments supporting U.S. concerns.The EAP Regional Media Hub in Tokyo hosted a journalists' roundtable with Gordon Duguidin Haiti on January 25 that included journalists from Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaperMalaysia's New Straits Times newspaper BERNAM.A (Malaysian National News Agency)and Australia's Canberra Times newspaper and Radio 6PR (Perth) and resulted in favorablestories appearing over the next few days in all participating media.NEAR EASTÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Lebanon: Television station Al-Jadid is not Hezbollah-affiliated with most of its fundingcoming from the Gulf and Libya. Their coverage is also routinely sensationalistic andmirrored Al-Manar's coverage. PAS Beirut clarified aspects of USG assistance in Haiti toAl-Jadid on January 20. On Saturday January 23 Al-Jadid hosted the PAO for 30 minuteson morning news talk-show al-Hadath to discuss American relief efforts in Haiti. The PAOwas able to address many of the accusations carried in the Al-Manar report including themyriad ""weapons testing"" myths being propagated by Russian and Venezuelan media outlets.[Post cannot engage directly with Hezbollah television station Al-Manar as it was designatedas a Special Designated Global Terrorist organization in 2006 under E.O. 13224]ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Morocco: On 1/28/10 the nationalist French-language daily L 'Opinion published an op-edentitled ""Haiti: After terror the dread..."" The paper is generally considered to be fairlyhostile to the USG however on 1/29/10 PAO Rabat and an FSN went to L 'Opinion todiscuss the op-ed. Post was amazed to find the staff including the writer himselfaccommodating and even apologetic during the meeting. The editor-in-chief immediatelyagreed that the piece had been unfair and the writer somewhat sheepishly explained himselfby saying that public opinion had not quite recovered from ""the Bush years"" but readilyacknowledged as well that the article was not balanced. PAO gave the writer a dossier ofWashington File articles and some information from Infocentral's regular updates which hepromised to use in writing a counterpoint article. On 2/1/10 L 'Opinion published an articleentitled ""The massive humanitarian action of the United States"" based on the articlesprovided by Post. The excellent article underscored the scope of American assistance bothgovernment and private sector to aide Haiti's earthquake victims.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Syria: Syrian state-run media coverage of the USG role in Haiti relief efforts has beenlargely negative and inaccurate portraying the U.S. military as occupying Haiti. Examplesinclude the Ba'ath party's Al-Baath newspaper publishing three critical articles (1/21/01)under the headlines: ""US Crimes in Haiti"" ""US Military Forces Tighten Grip on Haiti"" and""US Forces Stop Humanitarian Planes from Landing."" On 1/25/10 government-ownedTishreen published an op-ed claiming that the superpowers were rushing towards a militaryconquest of Haiti in order to profit from reconstruction operations which is the new methodof colonialism. On 1/28/10 DAS Maura Connelly met with Syrian Ambassador Mustafawho promised to work to halt the negative coverage coming from some Syrian outlets. Toencourage more balanced coverage Embassy Damascus will host a roundtable 2/3/10 with-journalists from government-owned and independent Syrian media. Post also extended apersonal invitation to an advisor of the Minister of Information.",0

"Setup for foreign policy TV debate on Thursday. Obviously this is a popular position. Clegg is now at the height of hispopularity and playing to public opinion. Clegg is pushing off both Brown (still suffering from Obama's dismissive slightsunpopularity of Afghanistan and deepest factor Bush poisoning of the well) and Cameron (making him an oldThatcherite pro-US anti-EU). Clegg is an ardent Europeanist not so much Americanist.http://itn.co.uk/b0929495306b2635ca77854b1db33626.htmlClegg: special relationship with US is overTue Apr 20 2010 20:38:43ctThe ""special relationship"" between Britain and the United States is over Nick Clegg has said.The Liberal Democrat leader said Barack Obama's administration ""understood the world had changed"" and the UK'sleaders needed to end their ""slavish"" devotion to Washington.Mr Clegg also warned against ""sabre-rattling"" over Iran's nuclear ambitions and repeated his pledge to offer a referendumon the UK's continued membership of the European Union when the issue next arose.The Lib Dems have ruled out replacing Trident with a like-for-like system and Mr Clegg said the UK should consider ""nothaving a continuous at sea deterrent"".In a speech to the Foreign Press Association in London Mr Clegg said it was time to challenge the ""conventional wisdom""that had lasted since the Suez crisis about the UK's relationship with the US.He said: ""I think it's sometimes rather embarrassing the way Conservative and Labour politicians talk in this kind of slavishway about the special relationship. If you speak to hard-nosed folk in Washington they think 'it's a good relationship but it'snot the special relationship'.""",0

"  DEAR FRIEND,   MY GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND I HOPE THIS  LETTER MEETS YOU IN GOOD HEALTH. I AM DIAKA TSHOMBE,  AIDE  TO THE LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO OF  ZAIRE NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO  (DRC).  I AM WRITING TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON YOUR  PROFILE I RECEIVED FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN  NIGERIA.   I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRSENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION AS  A  WAR REFUGEE HERE IN NIGERIA. FEW WEEKS BEFORE  THE LATE  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER,  I WAS  INSTRUCTED BY HIM TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE SUM OF  US$22MILLION WHICH WAS TO BE TRANSFERRED ABROAD AND  LODGED WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING  DISCLOSED AS FAMILY VALUABLES IN MY NAME PENDING  FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY 16  1997,  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO GAVE UP POWER TO THE  REBELS  LED BY LAURENT KABILA, WHO WERE ADVANCING FROM  KISINGANI AND FLED TO TOGO FROM WHERE HE LATER MOVED  TO MOROCCO WHERE HE DIED ON SEPTEMBER 7, 1997 LESS  THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER.  HE  WAS AGED 66 YEARS. I MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO NIGERIA WITH  MY SON  PATRICE, AGED 17 WHERE I AM PRESENTLY  RESIDING AS A  WAR REFUGEE SHORTLY AFTER THE CAPITAL CITY  KINSHASHA WAS OVER RUN OVER BY REBELS. I LOST MY  WIFE  AND MY TWO CHILDREN, AND ALL MY POSSESSIONS DURING  THE  REBEL ONSLAUGHT ON THE CAPITAL CITY.   THE LATE MOBUTU SESE-SEKO DURING HIS 30 YEAR RULE  AMASSED A PERSONAL FORTUNE OF US$8BILLION WITH  HOUSES  IN SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. HOWEVER, THE INCUMBENT  PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE  SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO  FREEZE ALL HIS ASSETS AND CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTIES.  I  THUS DECIDED TO LIE LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE  SITUATION, UNTIL WHEN THINGS GET BETTER LIKE NOW  THAT  PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND HIS SON JOSEPH  KABILA HAS TAKEN OVER.   I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY  ABROAD  WHERE THE MONEY IS STILL LODGED AS FAMILY VALUABLES.  THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM  KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO  INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME BY  RECEIVING THE MONEY ON MY BEHALF. ACKNOWLEDGE THIS  MESSAGE SO THAT I CAN GIVE YOU THE MODALITIES FOR  THE  CLAIM OF THE FUNDS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE  THE  HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH THIS BUSINESS  DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND  CONFIDENCE WHCH I HAVE REPOSED IN YOU.   IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST, I SHALL PUT YOU IN THE  PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE  CURRENTLY BEIGN MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER  MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES.  I  AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE OF  THE  MONEY AS SOON AS THE TRANSACTION IS CONCLUDED.   FOR THIS REASON, KINDLY FURNISH ME YOUR CONTACT  INFORMATION, WHICH IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND  FAX  NUMBERS FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE  RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL USING THE ABOVE EMAIL ADDRESS.

"Bismillahir Rahmaanir Raheem,Assalamo Alaikum,Wasalaam to you,and how are you doing?. My intention of contacting you is to =solicit your assistance for a project,  which will be mutually beneficial. =Though I know my decision to contact you is to a large extent unconventional, =the  prevailing circumstances necessitated my action. I am Haleema  Hamza =from Libya. I am married to Late Mallam Mustafa Hamza of blessed memory was =an oil explorer in Libya and Kuwait for twelve years before he died in the =year 2000. We were married  for twelve years without a child. He died after a =brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both =devoted Muslims. Since his death I too have been battling with both Cancer =and fibroid problems.When my late Husband was alive he made a huge deposit in =millions of US dollars with a Deposit Company in oversea. (I will tell you =the amount as we proceed).Recently, my doctor told me that I have only few months to live due to cancer =problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my =condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Muslim organization or =devoted Muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to =instruct herein. My parents died at a tender age and i was brought up in the =orphanage through the help of a devouted muslim.I want this Muslim =organization or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund =mosques,  orphanages, widows, and also propagating the word of ALLAH and to =ensure that the society upholds the views and belief of the Holy Quran.The Holy Quran emphasizes so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has =encouraged me to take the bold step. I took this decision because I don't =have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are into =some radical Organizations and I don't want a situation where this money will =be used in an Unholy manner. Hence the reasons for this bold decision, I know that after death I will be with ALLAH the most =beneficent and the most merciful. I don't need any telephone communication in =this regard because of my health, because of the presence of my husband's =relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. =With ALLAH all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply on =Email:hhamza@cooltoad.com, I shall give you the contact information of the =Deposit Company in oversea where the money was deposited. I will also issue a =letter of authority to the Deposit Company authorizing them that the said =fund have being willed to you and a copy of such authorization will be =forwarded to you. I want you and the Muslim community where you reside to =always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a true devoted Muslims =worthy of emulation, Whoever that wants to serve ALLAH must serve him in =truth and in fairness. I will not stipulate any precise amount to reward you, =as it will have to be on pre-negotiated terms, based on your level of =involvement. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply =will give room in sourcing for a Muslim organization or a devoted Muslim for =this same purpose. Until I hear from you by email, my dreams will rest =squarely on your Shoulders. May the Almighty ALLAH continue to guide and  =protect you.     Allah Hafiz.

Well Philippe looks right again. CNN is reporting this as being done against my wishes. Any way to salvage?,0
"officials awarded contracts that were grossly over-invoiced to Contractors.The present civilian government set up the Contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel,  to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts.My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and  members of this panel,we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$16,500,000.00(sixteen Million,five hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars). That is why I am writing you this letter.We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account,if you agree with our proposition as follows;(i) 10% to the account owner (you).(ii) 80% for us (the panel officials).(iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us )incidental to the actualisation of this project.We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them. Please note that this transactionis 100% safe and risk-free.We intend to effect the transfer within a few days from the date of receipt of the following information:Your name, companyÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s name, address and telephone and fax numbers, and your banking information. The above information will enable us write letters of claim andjob description respectively. This way, we will use your companyÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s name to apply for the payment and backdate the  award of the contract to your company.We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter and, I will bring you into a more detailedpicture of this transaction when I hear from you.Best regards,Dr. Williams Banigo",1

"Barclays Bank Plc 65/66 St. Mary Axe London EC3A 8LEI am Mr. Gary Adams, Senior Credit Officer, Barclays Bank Plc London. I am writing following an opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½12.5million British Pounds Sterling (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds Sterling) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this website.http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.htmlSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because the Bank cannot release the funds unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safe keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill.We agreed that 20% of this money would be for you as foreign partner, while the balance will be for my colleagues and I. We will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. Please be honest to me as trust is our watchword in this transaction.Note that this transaction is confidential and risk free. As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail whether or not you are willing to enter into this deal. In the event you are not interested, I sincerely ask that you disregard this email and tell no one about it. I am very careful on truncating my banking career should you mention this to someone else. I hope you can be trusted in this regard. Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has been finalized. We will discuss much in details when I do receive your response.Please in your response include your telephone and fax numbers for a better communication between us.You can reach me on the email belowBest regardsGary Adams",1

"AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION,AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK ( A.D.B )OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO,WEST AFRICA.Attention Please,I am Musa Garuba, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.The said amount was U.S$ 22.85M ( Twenty two million, eighty five thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when I hear from you.I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,Yours faithfully,Musa Garuba._________________________________________________________________MSN Hotmail sur i-modeÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ : envoyez et recevez des e-mails depuis votre tÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½lÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½phone portable ! http://www.msn.fr/hotmailimode/",1

""Obviously the big issue is how wedeal with various tax issues. And then there's the issue of an omnibus[spending bill] versus a continuing resolution. There are a lot of otherpotential issues. We're going to try to get the nutrition bill.""He was referring to ongoing talks over a possible extension of expiringprovisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts (PL 107-16 PL 108-27) thedebate over whether to move an omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2011 oranother temporary spending measure and a stalled child nutrition bill (HR5504).Van Hollen said that Pelosi D-Calif. did not bring up the issue of thetough caucus race for minority whip ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the second-ranking Democrat inthe next Congress ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ between Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland and James E.Clyburn of South Carolina. Both men were on the telephone call VanHollen said but the issue did not come up.Democratic aides said Pelosi has encouraged both men to reach asettlement to avert the potentially bloody intraparty fight. ""That wasn'tpart of the discussion"" Van Hollen said.",0

We have seen reforms after reforms by the government of Mugabe and we are fed up with it. Our economy is in shambles and it is just not profitable and safe enough for us to remain in Zimbabwe. We have decided to relocate our farm to Swaziland, a neighbouring country, where we have acquired lands. Our capital base is in South Africa where we are temporarily living pending such time logistics would be ready for full-scale operation in Swaziland.

"ACCOUNT.    I am Dr. Harry Macdonald the operational manager in account Management section in charge of credit and foreign bills in a prime bank here in South Africa, On a routine inspection, I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with Balance of US$56,559,000(fifty six Million Five Hundred and Fifty) Nine Thousand U.S dollars Only).The account holder was in charge of President Saddam Hussein's secret crude oil transactions in Africa.

"Dear Sir,I am Mr.Tambo, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me.

S. Dollars ($26,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send across to you.I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $26,.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel/Fax number or my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.Yours faithfully,Mr. Tambo   ",1

"My Lordship,  Calvary greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I am former Mrs. Fatima Abass Yakubu Idris now Mrs Mary Abass Yakubu Idris, a widow to Late Sheik Abass Yakubu Idris. I am 65years old; I am now a new Christian convert,suffering from long time cancer of the breast. From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live more than six months, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very Severe stage. My late husband was killed during the Gulf war, and during the period of our marriage we had a son who was also killed in a cold blood during the Gulf war. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death,I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for more than six months and I am so scared about this.  So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the development of evangelism in Africa,which is in my place,America Europe and Asian Countries.This mission, which will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocate to Nigeria, Africa where I live presently.  I selected you and your church after visiting the website for this Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of $2,200,000.00 Million US Dollars to your Church/Ministry for the development of evangelism and also as aids for the less privileged around you. Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security Company in Europe and the company has branches,therefore my lawyer will file an immediate application for the transfer of the money in the name of your ministry. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use,than enhancement of evangelism.  Lastly, I want you/your ministry to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without Jesus Christ in one's life is vanity upon vanity.If you have to die says The Lord, keep fit and I will give you the whole of my life. May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you. I awaits your urgent reply. YOURS IN CHRIST, SISTER MARY ABASS IDRIS.

"E-MAIL:obilolo@netscape.net E-MAIL:bello_dd@doctor.com Dear Friend, My name is DR,IDRIS BELLO, a member of the Presidential Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up. Early last year there was a major oil spillage in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over 70% of the communities homeless. A contract was awarded to a foreign firm to rehabilitate the communitties, because of the huge monetary profit I envisaged, we decided to over-invoice the contract sum. Now the contract has been completed and the original contractor has long been paid,but the contract balance of THIRTY EIGHT MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS(US$38 MILLION),which resulted from the over invoiced contract sum has been left in a suspense account with the DEBT RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE,A SUBSIDIARY OF OUR APEX BANK, This over invoice sum is what we intend to take out of the country for ourselves.The problem is as government officials,we are not suppose to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having foreign ones. To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a foreign partner who can assist us and receive this amount into your account. We are ready to share this money with you on the basis of participation.we also have plans to invest part of this money in any viable business in your country under your care,as we are nearing our retirement age. In any case, I received a reference of you/organization from the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and Industry =91Foreign Trade Division=92as a reputable organ that can assist us on this transaction. Please if you accept my proposal do not hesitate to reply to me on my e-mail:(bello_dd@doctor.com)or(obilolo@netscape.net) so that I can provide you with the basic procedures for the release of the fund.  It does not matter whether you or your company does contract project of the nature described here, the assumption is that you won a major contract and subcontracted it to another company, more often thannot, big trading companies or individuals of unrelated field win major contracts here in Nigeria and subcontracts same to more specialized firms for execution. The BENEFIT For providing the account where we shall remit this money, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire funds, 70% will be for me and my partners,while 5% has been set aside to cover any expenses thatmay be incurred by both parties during this transaction, both local and international. Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with utmost degree of maturity and confidentiality because I am still in active government service with the NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION.If I receive your response on time, this whole transaction could be accomplished within the shortest possible time based on your interest and determination,since the money is already on transit.",1

"Good Day,With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation. My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!nd) to seek for political asylum.I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam. President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here.I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.Your role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.To know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola, click on the links below and read. http://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.htmlhttp:/ews.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africaewsid_1839000/1839252.stmSincerely,O.C.Savimbi.",1

"Direct and private cell number +447040114795Direct and private Telephone + 447040121012Direct and private fax number +447005804255Dear Friend,I am Mr. T. Smith, deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safekeeping.No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes.The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like houses, hotels and doing charity works etc)Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we can have a smooth communication.Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email ( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com )Thanks and regards.TONY SMITH N.BReply me only on this my alternative emailttss7520062006@mixmail.com   ",1

"Goodday,You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don=92t know me =personally, I am DR RANI ALI JUMA, the first son of DR. OMAR ALI JUMA, and he =was the VICE PRESIDENT of the REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA. Before he died, my father =died at the age of 63 in the year 2001 after addressing fellow TANZANIANS =during the visit of PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA of DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO =and YUERI MUSEVENI of UGANDA. I got your contact through the Ghana =information Exchange (G.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person = to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of =fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you.My late father was among the ruling party (CCM) which the opposition party =was dominated by his Muslim brothers led by PROF. IBRAHIM LIPUMBA. Before his =death he had taken to Europe  to deposit the sum of US$40 million (FORTY =MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) with a security and finance company as if he =foresaw the looming danger coming. The money was deposited in two sealed =boxes as valuables goods to avoid much demurrage from the security company. I =most say that the death of my father has warned me and my whole family not to =go back to politics. For the fact that PRESIDENT BENJAMIN MKAPA, never showed =any concern since the death of my father and after I discovered that my life =was no longer safe I decided to leave to Ghana ,West Africa where I am =residing now with my own family.Meanwhile here in Ghana West Africa I don=92t think of going back and for =this I and my family have decided to transfer my father=92s money into a =foreign account in a Islamic counrty. As the eldest son of my father, I am =saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where =this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who =have tactically frozen our family wealth as I may not trust the system of =African government. Furthermore, the new Ghana government does not allow such =investment hence I am seeking for asylum. As a business person whom I must =entrust my future and that of my family into his hands I must let you know =that this transaction is 100% RISK FREE and the nature of your business does =not necessarily matter.Therefore, if you accept to assist me and my family, we are willing to offer =you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, 75% for me and my family, while =5% will be mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred in the process of =this transaction. We wish to invest our money on commercial property based on =your advice and I will also wish to receive your genuine assurance that you =would not sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your personal =or company=92s account. If this transaction is acceptable by you.BEST REGARDSDR. RANI ALI JUMA.  --d6b9cac0-c60a-11d8-8772-0004aca2aa72--",1
"A Foreigner a french, Late Engr.Peter Claude  (Snr) a merchant in The Republic of South Africa, Formerly working in  Witwatersrand Johannesburg Gold Mine, Johannesburg South Africauntil his death few year ago in Kenya Air Bus (A310 - 304)Flight KQ431,He banked with us at Ned Credict Bank Johannesburg and had a closing balance as at the end of September, 2000 worth $30,800.000.00 (Thirty Million eight hundred United State Dollars), (this is aside the accruedinterest so far from that date) the bank now expects his next of kin as beneficiary. Valuable efforts are being made by the Bank to get in touch with any of the Claude's Family or Relatives but to no success.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of Late Engr. Peter Claude (Snr.)'s next of kin . The Management under the influence of our Chairman and Members of the Board of Directors, Thus that arrangement will be made for the fund to be decleared ""Unclaimed"" and subsequentlly be donated to the trust fund for arms andammunition to further enhance the course of War in Africa and the Worldin General. In order to avert this negative development, some of my trusted colleagues and I, now seek your permission to have you stand as next of kin to the late Engr.peter Claude  (Snr.) so that the fund will be released and paid into your Account as the beneficiaryext of kin.  The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasionedby the fact that the customer(Claude) was a foreigner and a Local person here in the country  cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.All documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be carefully worked out. We have secured from the probate registry, an order of Mandamus to locate any of the deceased's beneficiary(ies), and more so we are assuring you that this business is 100% Risk Free. Your share will be 30% of the total sum while 10% will be set aside for any expences incured during the course of transaction, The rest of 60% will be for myself and my colleagues for investment purposes, According to agreement between both parties. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where-in the money will be remitted . I willalso instruct you on how you can add in your application to our bank sothat you get paid through our corresponding bank  overseas as this willbe easier for us. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you byfax or email the text of the application.  Please note that for the purposes of confidentiality, all further correspondeces would be through my alternative email address:macontu1@webmail.co.za or through my telephone +874-762919-885.

Per the plan a statement is being released in your name. This is the same statement you saw in the memo packagefrom Mitchell:Today's announcement by the Government of Israel helps move forward toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinianconflict. We believe that through good-faith negotiations the parties can mutually agree on an outcome which ends theconflict and reconciles the Palestinian goal of an independent and viable state based on the 1967 lines with agreedswaps and the Israeli goal of a Jewish state with secure and recognized borders that reflect subsequent developmentsand meet Israeli security requirements. Let me say to all the people of the region and world: our commitment toachieving a solution with two states living side by side in peace and security is unwavering.,0

There is an account opened in this bank in 1983 and since 1991 nobody has operated on this account again but all this came to light after an internal auditing that I conducted by going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out&nbsp;immediately it would be forfeited for no reason.The owner of this account is MR SMITH B. ANDREAS, a foreigner, and a miner at Kruger gold co, a geologist by profession and he died since 1990. No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to ! me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (US$26M) TWENTY SIX MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS.<BR><BR>I&nbsp; am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in US Dollars and the former owner of the account was MR SMITH B. ANDREAS. We will sign an agreement, but&nbsp;I assure you that it is real and a genuine business. Please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take immediately. Send also your private telephone number and a fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face or sign a binding agreement&nbsp;together so that&nbsp;we can receive this money into a foreign account or any account of our choice where the fund will be safe. And I will fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and other investments. </STRONG></P><P><STRONG>I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreign account and&nbsp; a foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.&nbsp;I have a correct information of this account, which I will give to you later, if you are able and willing to handle such an amount of money in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again in my life. I need a trustworthy person in this business because I donÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t want to make a mistake, I need your strong assurance and trust. With my position now in the&nbsp;office I can transfer this money to any foreign reliable account, which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending my physical arrival in your country for sharing. I will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place.</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>You can also come to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and two of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account. I will use my position and influence to effect the legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange departments. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 30% of the total amount 60% will be for me, and meanwhile 10% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring.

It's worth you checking in with him before the meeting. His quick report of meeting with Allawi:1. Allawi said he pulled back from striking a deal with ISCI because he is concerned that the Shia representation istoo small and there is too much difficulty in trying to widen2. Allawi asked bill if he thought Maliki was serious suggesting that he was toying with the idea of a grand coalition3. Allawi will see Barzani on the 11thBill's overall take is that Allawi might now be looking to test the wider coalition proposition and is not as interested inthe ISCI gambit as first option.Bill has also seen AI-Mahdi Talabani and Zebari. He said there would be a good meeting with Maliki he's obviouslyfeeling confident but was firm on limiting role of Sadrists and need to bring Iraqiyya into inclusive govt.,0

I know this is a very difficult time for everyoneat the Mission and our thoughts are with all of you.I had a good conversation with Jim Williams about the strategic communications initiative and I wanted to bring you upto speed on our thinking and where things stand with Keith.Based on our discussions and the excellent paper that Jim prepared I think there are several critical areas that we needto address:ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Work with our counterparts in the Mexican government to help them develop their capacity to handle thecommunications aspects of the drug initiative more effectivelyÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Develop a process for ensuring the GOM and USG have clear coordinated and consistent messaging on allaspects of the initiativeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Increase public awareness in Mexico about ""Merida"" ; based on a report I got from INR last week there is verylittle awareness or understanding of the program in Mexico and the contributions of USGÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Work with GOM to develop an on-going and effective communications strategy at all levels to provide peopleacross the country with information that is directly relevant to them and which they need to navigate their waythrough this crisis. For example what is going on in their community; what are local authorities doing; whatprograms are available in their schools; what can they do etc. I have increasingly come to believe that the lackof this sort of ""personally relevant"" information at a time of crisis increases public anxiety and contributes to theoverall sense of things being out of control. We have begun to focus on this issue and have worked both in Haitiand last year in Pakistan to provide people with a steady stream of information they can use. We are using awide array of communications tools to deliver these messages that allows the information to be delivered in avery granular local personal way. The other benefit of this approach is that it helps balance the steady streamof gruesome news being put out by traditional media.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Work with private sector in both Mexico and US to develop broad based PSA campaign to increase awareness ofthe initiative and maintain public support for the effortÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Increase awareness in Mexico of USG efforts to combat drug use in USKeith has reached out to a number of his associates at BDA and unfortunately he has met with some resistance to BDAtaking this project on. The personal safety issue seems to be the biggest concern. I do believe we will be able toovercome this to some degree and I have some ideas which we can discuss when we next speak. In the meantime I havereached out to Pat Mitchell of the Paley Center and she believes she will be able to help engage the US private sectoronce we have a plan of action in place.Finally with regard to next week's trip by S Jim feels it might be better for me to come to Mexico sometime in late Aprilrather than have it as part of next week's agenda. I am happy to do whatever works best for you. Keith is also preparedto come next week or in April. Just let us know.Judth",0
"sbwhoeopFriday December 3 2010 9:55 AMH: Roger Cohen in NYT: ""American Diplomacy Revealed ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ as Good""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/opinion/03iht-edcohen.html?hpDecember 2 2010American Diplomacy Revealed as GoodBy ROGER COHENNEW YORK ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!They are to judge from the WikiLeaks dump of a quarter-million of their private or secret cables thoughtful well-informedand dedicated servants of the American interest who write clear declarative English sentences.I've not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-chatter about these admirable career diplomats whose diplomacy is nowcondemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they whose lives have been upturned. Every journalist knows that if theircorrespondence over several years was suddenly made public they would lose most of their sources. That should giveevery journalist pause.So it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will self-censor. They will go quiet particularly in the moreconspiratorial parts of the world which also tend to be the most unstable like the Middle East. Layers of secrecy will beadded.Julian Assange the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks has hurt U.S. interests across a broad but probably shallowspectrum. That will satisfy him in that he's a self-styled foe of the United States. The guy makes me queasy.Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ beyond the ""shock"" of venal Gulf Arab Sunnileaders looking for war on the cheap against Shiite Iran so long as it doesn't disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or the""shock"" of Pakistani double-dealing and nuclear procrastination; or the ""shock"" of yet more premature Israeli predictionson when Iran will have a nuclear weapon; or the ""shock"" of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the ""shock"" of theChinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the ""shock"" of Muammar el-Qaddafi's taste for voluptuous Slavic women andSilvio Berlusconi's taste for all women ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ perhaps the biggest shock of all is just how professional sober and short onembarrassment all these cables are and just how much they conform with the world as we already knew it right down tothe familiar adjectives evoking French President Nicolas Sarkozy: ""hyperactive"" ""mercurial"" ""authoritarian"" ""erratic""""monarch-like.""I swear if they hadn't become diplomats a lot of these State Department people could have become good hacks.Overall my longstanding admiration for America's conscientious diplomats has been redoubled not least for thisunderreported nugget on the turbulent Iranian election of 2009 contained in a cable of Jan. 12 2010 from Dubai: ""Whilewe don't know nor might not ever know the real June 12 vote count it is clear that the turnout was at record high levelsand that there was systematic vote count fraud (if in fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that Ahmadinejad 'wonbig' in the first round.""It is good to know that this is the innermost conviction of American diplomacy: the fraud was evident to anyone in Tehranduring the election and its violent aftermath.A couple more observations on Iran: The first is that the Sunni autocrats of the Gulf are as exercised as they are aboutTehran in part because they know that any U.S.-Iranian breakthrough might make them more dispensable to the UnitedStates. Their vested interest in the prevailing Middle Eastern strategic equation is strong; nothing would redraw the MiddleEast more than overcoming the U.S.-Iranian psychosis.The second is that President Barack Obama's approach to Iran has been much more conventional than his initial outreachsuggested. Old habits of attempted coercion trumped originality. Very quickly he fell back on Dennis Ross's tired thinkingabout balancing ""appetizing carrots"" with ""sharp sticks"" in tackling Iran's nuclear program.The cables reveal that as early as March 2009 a senior U.S. diplomat was talking ""dual track"" telling Europeans that""engagement alone is unlikely to succeed"" and calling for added ""pressure."" Perhaps Iranian skepticism could never havebeen overcome; certainly this approach guaranteed longstanding Iranian grievances would fester.Assange himself clearly understands nothing of Iran or the Middle East or diplomacy. In an interview with Time heexpressed approval for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""coming out with a very interesting statement thatleaders should speak in public like they do in private whenever they can"" and bought into Netanyahu's view that this inAssange's words would ""lead to some kind of increase in the peace process in the Middle East and particularly in relationto Iran.ItHuh? Netanyahu was referring to Arab leaders' now-documented private calls for a U.S.-led war against Iran an option healso favors. And that for Assange is a step forward to peace! He's all over the place.What should we make of this brainy naÃÂÃÂ¯f who told my colleague John Burns that America is a threat to democracy? He's aloose canon; let him be. My impression is he's self-armed with a spade and he's digging.And what of the messenger's message? The cables are intriguing offering plenty of voyeuristic titillation but no gasp ofdiscovery. They provide texture but break little new ground. Yet their publication has done significant damage to thecourageous work of America's diplomats and may endanger lives. That's a tradeoff that I find troubling and unpersuasive.",0

" Good day,It is my humble pleasure to write this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me. However, I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature in respect of this, I got your contact through an uprooted search on the internet. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the dayI am Stevens Bangura, son of late Mr John Bangura of Sierra Leone who was killed by the Sierra Leone's rebel forces on the 24th of December,1999 in my country Sierra Leone.When he was still alive, he deposited one trunk box containing the sum of USD$30 million dollars in cash (Ten Million dollars). with a private security and safe deposit company here in Abidjan Cote d=B4Ivoire. This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond by my mother and she have already decided to use this money for future investment of the family.Recently, I rushed down to Abidjan after being able to locate where my late father kept the depository Agreement made between himself and the security company. I have confirmed from the security company that the consignment is in their custody, when I demanded for the release of the consignment to me in my capacity of being the son of Mr Bangura, the depositor of the consignment, I was told that in the absence of my father, the only person that can demand for the release of the consignment is my late father=B4s foreign partner on whose behalf the consignment was deposited.Meanwhile, my father have instructed me that in the case of his death, that I should look for a trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this money from C=F4te d=B4Ivoire immediately for investment .Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to transfer this fund into your Account, but I will demand for the following requirement:(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account wherethis fund will be transferred to in your country after retrieving the box containing the money from the custody of the security company.(2) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable business venture that would not require much technical expertise in your country where part of this fund will be invested?I am a Christian and I will please, want you to handle this transaction based on the trust I have established on you.For your assistance in this transaction, I have decided to compensate you with 10 percent of the total amount at the end of this business. The security of this business is very important to me and as such, I would like you to keep this business very confidential.I shall expect an early response from you.Thank you and God bless.Yours sincerely,Stevens Bangura_________________________________________________________ Gagne une PS2 !

Spoke with Byrd's people too....they think he is leaning tosupport it but would know for sure later today.Nelson to back 'Don't ask' repealBy: Jen DiMascioMay 26 2010 12:08 PM EDTNebraska Sen. Ben Nelson (D) will back repeal of don't ask don't tell likely putting repeal proponents over the top intheir quest to end the ban on gays serving openly in the military.""I don't believe that most Nebraskans want to continue a policy that not only encourages but requires people to bedeceptive and to lie. The 'Don't Ask Don't Tell' policy does just that"" Nelson said. ""It also encourages suspicion andsenior officers to look the other way. In a military which values honesty and integrity this policy encourages deceit.""""I will support the Lieberman compromise because it removes politics from the process. It bases implementation of therepeal on the Pentagon's review and a determination by our military leaders that repeal is consistent with militaryreadiness and effectiveness and that the Pentagon has prepared the necessary regulations to make the changes"" hesaid adding that he spoke with Defense Secretary Robert Gates about the issue.""He advised that while he preferred waiting until the study is completed he can live with this compromise"" Nelson said.Given statements made by Sens. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) that they too willvote for repeal Nebraska's Nelson would be the critical 15th vote required for repeal to be included in the defenseauthorization bill.Their decisions were also made after earlier news this week that both the White House and Gates could live with acompromise amendment sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Pa.).""We thank Senator Nelson for his support and are extremely grateful. He and other senators supporting repeal will beon the right side of history"" said Joe Solmonese president of the Human Rights Campaign.

"FROM Williams Ghazi,JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.TELL:+27-732112866.Dear sir,I am MR, Williams Ghazi, the son of lateMR.PATRICK Ghazi, who was murdered in a land disputein ZIMBABWE.I got your contact during my search forreliable&compitent foreigner to handle a confidentialfinancial transaction, then I decided to write you. Mylate father was among the few black Zimbabwean richfarmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of theruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for hisalleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean oppositionparty. Before the death of my father, he took me to SouthAfrica to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars($12m) with a security and finance company, as if heknew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money wasdeposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid muchdumourage from the security firm.This money was earmarked for the purchase of newmachinery and chemicals for the farms and theestablishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.This land problem arose when President R. MUGABEintroduced a new land Act. which wholly affects theWhite rich farmers and some few blacks vehementlycondemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by thegovernment. This resulted to rampant killing and mobactions. I and my family who are currently staying in SouthAfrica as refugees or asylum seekers have decidedto enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of theTrunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futhertransfer of the money to a foreign country where wecan invest it. I am faced with the dilemma ofclaiming/investing this amount of money in SouthAfrica for fear of encountering the same experience infuture since both countries have the same politicalhistory. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law doesnot allow such investment hence I am seeking foran asylum or refugee.I must let you know that this business is 100% riskfree and the nature of your business does notnecessary matter. So if you are willing to assist usclaim the ownership of this money,I and my family haveagreed to give you 20% of the total money, 40% will befor a joint business venture I will be doing with youand another 35% will be for me and my family which weshall also invest in your country and the remaining 5%will be mapped out for all expenses we may incureduring the transaction.Therefor, if you are willing and interested to renderthe needed assistance. Please funish me your private phone and Fax number for easy and better communication.Remember that this is highly confidential and thesuccess of this business depends on how secret it is kept.Expecting your reply soonest.Best Regard.Williams Ghazi.

Unfortunately we are unable to open Bank Accounts in the United US without first registering the company name.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Presently with the amount of Orders we have, we cannot put them on hold. For fear of loosing the customers out rightly. Secondly we cannot cash these payments from the US soon enough, as international Checks take about 14 working days for cash to be made available. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>We lose about 75,000 USD of net income each month because we have money transfer delays. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>You are not involved in any sales. Once orders are received and sorted, we deliver the product to a customer (usually through FEDEX/UPS).The customer receives and checks the products. After this has been done the customer has to pay for the products. About 90 percent of our customers prefer to pay through Certified Cheque and Money orders based on the amount involved. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>YOUR TASK ARE:<BR>1. Receive payment from Customers<BR>2. Cash Payment at your Bank<BR>3. Deduct 10% which will be your percentage/pay on Payment processed<BR>4. Forward balance after deduction of percentage/pay to any of the offices you will be instructed to send payment to. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Our payments will be issued out in your name and you can have them cashed in your bank or other Cashing Services. Deduct your weekly salary and forward the balance to the company via western union money transfer or Money Gram. We understand it is an unusual and incredible job position. This job takes only 3-7 hours per week. You'll have a lot of free time doing another job, you'll get good income and regular job. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>This job is very challenging and you should understand it.

"OML SA , 2nd Floor, Building 3,Grayston Drive, Sandton, Jo,burg,South Africa.Dear, I am Mr.Smith Anderso the Head of Audit Department, African Developemnet Bank,south Africa And for reasons which will become obvious to you as you read on, I obtained your address particulars from an Internet address listing. Please exercise some patience and read through my message. I have a very urgent and confidential business proposition for you. On June 6th 1999, a Crude Oil Contractor with the Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation, Engr. Ahmed Youseff Mustafa , a national of kuwait, made a numbered time ( fixed) deposit for 12 calendar months, value $36MUSD (Thirty six million United States dollars only)in my branch. On maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally, his contract employers, the Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation wrote to inform us that Engr. A Y Mustafa died on an automobile accident; that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin through the kuwait embassy were fruitless. I therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Mustafa had actively opposed the Government of his country kuwait, and was consequently driven into exile. My proposal therefore is that, I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Mustafa. It is not necessary to be a blood relation to Mr. Mustafa, nor have the same name. It is not also necessary to come from the same Country. I have worked out the modalities to achieve my aim of appointing a next of kin, and therefore also by this means we transfer this money total $36MUSD abroad for us to share. No one will ever come forward to claim it now, and according to South African law,after 9 years, the money will automatically revert to the Government Treasury if the Account owner is a foreigner, and certified dead, and there is no valid claim. This indeed, is the situation. The money transfer paperwork itself will include a certificate of origin so that the receiving bank does not ask questions or refuse the money as money laundering. Also, the paperwork will include proper certification that the funds being transferred are from non criminal sources. In short this will be a proper and legal money transfer and there is no risk!. Once you indicate your interest I will initiate the processing of the transfer and in about 14 working days the money total $36MUSD will be in your nominated bank account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. Looking forward to your urgent reply. Reply to this email:smith_ad505@yahoo.com Yours truly,Mr.Smith Anderso.",1
Can you also fax one to Bill at home in NY? Do you have #?,0
Thanks so much. I don't know what the NSC has or will read so we need to think of this submission as representing ourviews for historical purposes.,0

My Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led =by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death,Mr. =Antonio Dembo and general Paulo Lukamba who were his second in commands, =assumed office as leaders of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had =carried the party with in Dembo and general lukamba,there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos =Morgado lobbied to depose them and assume office as leader to enrich =themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, =including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tensionand confusion in UNITA became uncontrollable when Mr.Dembo died 10days after =my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for =three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as =there is now no sense of direction. I nowdesire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For =this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek political =asylum.I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in =respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds =sales. This money (Eighteen Million Dollars Only), which was already on its =way to my Uncle's Swiss Bankaccount, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on =transit with a private safe deposit security company here in =Amsterdam,Netherlands. in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's =death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment =containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waitedfor sometime now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your =reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to the =netherlands to sought for political asylum here is because of the safe =deposit. President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my =Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done =this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not =declare the funds to the here.I plan to use this money to safeguard my families future. It is very =essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to =put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order =not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be =treated with utmost secrecy.Your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the =money which is deposited in my name from the Security and finance company, =after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account =you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned =to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have =permission to do business and open an account here. For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with Fifteen Percent of the =Money of the money. I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the =funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the =release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for =transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed =immediately depending on your prompt response.I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve =this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This =will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your =part.To know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola, click on the =link below and read. http://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.htmlhttp:/ews.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africaewsid_1839000/1839252.stmTHANKS,GOD BLESS.Sincerely,Savimbi.Please let me know you got my email by replying to my personal email address =:savimbi765@zensearch.com    --8b590df2-1ba4-49b9-8c7d-1b99600063bf--",1

Some timeearly 1997, a reputable client of ours depositedaconsignment in our company\'s vault for safekeeping.And since then our client has failed to comeforward to claim his consignment, which hasaccumulated aconsiderable amount of money indemurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact thisclient to redeem the demurrage which his consignmenthad accumulated we discovered that our client was theformer president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, whodied of illness after he was de-throwed in the sameyear the consignment was entrusted into our care.Sincethe death of our client President Mobutou Seseseko,none of his benefactors has come forward to claim theconsignment with us, which means that non of hisrelatives or aids had any knowledge of thisconsignment.Hence out of curiosity I decided to secretly open thetwo boxes that our client deposited in our vault. Andto my surprise I discovered that the two boxes thatwere registered as treasurer by our client actuallycontained a considerable amount of money in UnitedStates Dollars amounting to about US$30 millionDollar. Since this development I have been nursingplans secretly. I also found out from enquiries andthe foreign media that our late client siphoned a lotof money from his country while he was in office ashead of state.It is my conviction that the consignmentin our vault was part of the money that our clientsiphoned and now that he is dead there is no race tothis money in our care.I am now soliciting your nobleassistance to assist me in transferring this money outof nigeria to your country for immediate investmentwith your assistance.I have also decided that you willgenerously been titled to 30% of the total amount.Upon my receiptof your reply confirming yourwillingness to assist me of this transaction, I willimmediately arrange and transfer all the rights ofownership of this consignment to your name tofacilitate your easy clearance and transfer of thecomplete funds to yourcountry.you have nothing to worry about, as I will be thereto assist you in anyway necessary with all properdocumentation.This transaction is 100% risk free.Please maintainabsolute confidentiality on this matter.Please reply to the above email address with yourtelephone and fax so can call you.Thanks.Yours faithfully.MR.ISA MUHAMEED__________________________________________________________________Get Tiscali Broadband From =A315:99http://www.tiscali.co.uk/products/broadbandhome/",1

"  Hello this letter might come to you as a surprise since, we have not had any previous correspondence or meet. i need your help. As a reliable one and trustworthy person that can help  i saw your information on internet and i am really interested in you.I am the above named person but now undergoing medical treatment in London, England. I am married to Dr. Jim Walter who worked with British Railway Commission in Chelsea England for over a decade before he died on 5th of July in the year 2003. We were married for fifteen years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for two weeks.   Before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of ÃÂÃÂ£1 Million (One Million Pounds sterling) in a Vault with a Security company in JAPAN.  Presently, this money is still  there. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next 30 days due to cancer problem.Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.  Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to an individual or better still a God fearing person who will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct . I want an individual that will use this fund and provide succor to poor and indigent persons, orphanages, and above all those affected in the Tsunami in far Asia.and  youI understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not inclined to helping poor persons and I do not want my husbands hard earned money to be misused or spent in the manner in which my late husband did not specify. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going.   I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Almighty.  I do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health, .With God all things are possible.As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Security company in JAPAN. I want you to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Whosoever that wants to serve the Almighty must serve him with all his heart and mind and soul and also in truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for an individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act according to my specification herein. Hoping to hear from you.Thank you and may the Almighty bless you.pls Reply me to helen_waiter@yahoo.com Yours sincerely, Mrs.Helen Walter Anne ---------------------------------Everyone is raving about the all-new Yahoo!

"Hello Sir,I am Mrs. Comfort Usman Wase, widow of the late Col. Usman Wase, son of the =Emir of Wase, Plateau State, Nigeria. My late husband was the Military =Administractor of Kano State during the reign of the late General Sani =Abacha. He died in the ill-fated Executive Air Services EAS aircraft that =crashed at the Heipan airport near Jos, the Plateau state capital. My late =husband was close to the then Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the =Federal Republic of Nigeria and he enjoys regular largesse from the Head of =State as the Military Administrator of Kano State where the president came =from.Regularly, my late husband bags these largesse in local and foreign =currencies to his village (Wase) where they are stored in big trunk boxes in =his father Emir's palace.  These funds were so staggering that the Emir, my =late husband's father advised him to make silos for the funds. 12 large =overhead water tanks were made in the premises of the Emir's Palace and all =the funds were transferred and stored there. The funds in the silos were top =secret between my late husband and his father whom he deceived into believing =that the money belong to General Sani Abacha, the then Head of State.  After my late husband's death in the ill-fated air craft on 7th January, 1997 =leaving his large fortune unprotected. The head of State General Sani Abacha =paid a condolence visit to the Emir, my late husband's father, the old man =believing that the fund in the silos belongs to the head of state and knowing =how brutal he was at that time informed the head of state of the money his =son has been keeping for him. He thanked the old man and ordered the money to =be moved to Aso Rock - Abuja (Government House at the Federal Capital =Territory). The money was removed with special army bullion vans in the most =bizarre manner that nothing was left for us (the family) to inherit. To us on =that day, it was like another river has emptied its water into the ocean.  =Our problems (me and my children) started from that day.I have just been informed by my late husband's attorney, our family attorney =Barrister I.K. Saggay, Principal Partner - Casefile & Co. that my late =husband operated secret domiciliary account with fictitious name in one of =the commercial banks and all the funds amounting to has been credited in his =favour and I the widow was nominated as the next of kin as stated in his WILL =and last testament. He has now instructed me to seek in confidence a foreign =partner who will assist me in transferring the funds abroad to secure the =future and education of my children. The attorney has said that the =conditional is very favourable for the fund to be transferred.In the light of the above, I would like you to contact me if you are =interested in this project so that I can direct you to our family attorney =who will furnish you with further details and the modalities on how the fund =can be wired to your bank account. You will be at liberty to negotiate a =commission for your assistance with our family attorney. On the contrary, if =this proposal does not meet your requirement or you are not interested, =please do not hesitate to inform us so that we can make an alternative =arrangement.Kind regards,Mrs. Comfort Usman WaseMrs_comfort_Usmanwase@ciudad.com.ar  --71eef270-deb5-4f13-9cf3-7eee4f34a132--",1

Jerry as you may recall was Guiliani's homeland security guy in NYC and became B6one of the world's experts. He also worked for Clinton Admn and helped with disaster relief (including earthquakes)around the world. He called me today with some suggestions (some of which may be moot) so I asked him to put theminto a memo. Here it is for what it's worth:I think the fundamental issue is that no one seems to be in charge and noone person has been tasked with trying to pull all of the pieces togetherinto a short term and long term plan. Obviously in the short term searchand rescue and food and water are the main priorities. There seems to belittle communication between the various areas where people have congregatedand a central command post where agencies can call or radio for additionalsupplies including food water and medical.I don't recommend DoD be put in charge of this. They rarely have the kind oftouch that brings together all the necessary agencies under one roof. Iwould set up a central command that has representatives from all federalagencies in one place. There is no reason things should be thisdisorganized. I would break the island into grids and assign one person tobe the coordinator for each of the grids. That person will be responsiblefor all activities within their grid and will report activities to theisland on-scene coordinator. We should get a radio company like Motorola toset up temporary towers and give the State Department several hundred radiosso everyone involved in the response is able to communicate with the commandpost and with each other.I think one of the most important roles for DoD is to provide security forthe rescue teams and medical teams. They also should be responsible for theoperation of the airport for off loading planes and for scheduling allincoming flights so there is no lost time waiting for planes to land. I alsothink DoD should be responsible for airlifting supplies that are requestedby each one of the grid coordinators. Additionally the helicopters shouldbe used to move critical patients to the hospital ship on the way and to theaircraft carrier currently on station. At least once a day the coordinatorassigned by the President and the Secretary of State should be responsiblefor getting situation reports from all agencies on site particularlyregarding food and water security medical and search and rescue.The lack of command and control is allowing the situation to become morechaotic rather than more coordinated. I believe that if the Secretary wereto talk to the other nations involved through the UN they would besupportive of better coordination.Bottom line is that there is no order to the operation and you need strongpeople in there who can speak on behalf of the President and the Secretaryand get things under control quickly.I hope this is helpful. If you or the Secretary have any questions pleasefeel free to call me on my cell We leave for Tokyo at 7:15 amtomorrow and transfer to a United flight due back in DC at 2:30 pm tomorrow.Please give the Secretary my best regards. I hope to see you soon.B6,0

"DearPlease let this letter not to bring confusion to you. Iknow that we have not met either before but hear me fromthe dept of your mind. It is circumstances that made tosend this to you.I will introduce myself first to you, My name is VictoriaAbuchi, I lost my mother, my hero and my lord Ms Abu a yearago. She was poisioned to death by her associate inbusiness. She formed a company by one Mr. PhilipBrown who poisioned her only to take benefit of the multimillion venture. He was arrested immedaitely my mother diedand he entered an agreement with my mother's brothers thatI and the immedaite younger brother of my mother willrepresent my mother's interest in the company. After sixmonths I was kicked out of the company because I said thatwe have to change the company's lawyer who I termed waspart of the elimination of my mother. I did not know thatthey have changed all the company's document without myname appearing any where. I will have to let you know moredetail on that but let me move to the point why I amcontacting you.I have been nick named bastard by my mother's relations,They have named me all source of names even calling meoutcast because my mother is late, while my mother was thebread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of mymother's mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books threeweeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive wasinspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is ahuge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is$9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement shemade with the bank indicated that, the money was to be usedto purchase machinery for the establishment of a newcompany of her own.Please all I need from you is to do all you can to help meto get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bankwhere this money is deposited immediately, and confirmedthe account most deligently. The bank told me that mymother informed them that the money was to be remitted toher company's costumer account abroad, which her costumerwill provide to them but since then they have never heardfrom her nor the costumer. Now my mother is late. I don'twant the bank to know that my mother is late. I told themthat she is ill and appointed me to represent her in heraffairs.(1).I want you to provide an account where the money willbe remitted into as my mother's costumer. (2).Makearrangement for me to leave here as soon as possible(3).How much commission you will take for rendering theassistant?My mother did not marry to any man, She had me as the onlychild while she was having an affair with the person thatsurpposed to be my father when she was 18 years and the manabandoned her and disappeared which forced her to remainsingle. Now I am 20 years and never saw my father for aday.I have no home now and my life is in danger. I don'thave any one to run into. All the members of my motherfamily have turned their back on me because I demand for meright. They told me that I don't belong to the family. ThatI should go and look for my father, Whom I don't know. Ihave made trace to know my father without sucess. I wantyou to hear me from the inner most of your heart and accordme this help.God will bless you for saving my life and future.Best wishes,Victoria Abuchi.",1

Rather curiously he is not scheduled to meet with Secretary of StateHillary Clinton in the course of his visit to Washington.Contrary to his previous visit in March this time the US administration intends to create the impressionoutwardly at least that the severe crisis in the relationship has passed and that the relations between thetwo countries are as strong as ever. In order to bolster that impression the two leaders will meet the mediatogether and will be photographed. As opposed to the previous time Netanyahu will also be put up at BlairHouse the official White House guesthouse and not at a hotel.That said officials in Washington are waiting apprehensively for the answers that Netanyahu will provide inthe course of the meeting which is expected to address the transition from the proximity talks that are at animpasse to direct negotiations. Obama apparently will demand that Netanyahu agree to extend theconstruction freeze in Judea and Samaria beyond the September 26 expiration date in hope of securing PAChairman Abu Mazen's consent to begin direct talks with Israel. For the time being the forum of seven isdivided over this issue.Read more of this post",0

"Editorial: Mrs. Clinton in PakistanNEW YORK TIMESOctober 30 2009Hillary Rodham Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as secretary of state was never going to be easy. The day she arrivedextremists detonated a car bomb at a crowded market in Peshawar that killed at least 100 people. The Nationnewspaper dismissed the visit as a mere ""PR exercise but who will buy what the US is selling is difficult to imaginebeyond the already compliant government.""Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Pakistanis dislike and mistrust the United States. They blame Washingtonfor using and then abandoning them after the Soviets were driven from Afghanistan. And they resent Washington forpressing their government now to fight against extremists ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ and suspect that they will be abandoned again. The factthat many of the extremists are on Pakistan's territory and threatening Pakistan's government has not shifted thatthinking or mitigated that resentment.A good part of this of course is the failure of Pakistan's government which has still not adequately explained that this isnot just America's fight. But the United States is also to blame. For eight years the Bush administration coddled thePakistani Army at the expense of the rest of society.Mrs. Clinton challenged Pakistan's government to do more to shut down Al Qaeda but she was rightly determined touse this visit to also broaden the relationship.Instead of just courting President Asif All Zardari and the army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani Mrs. Clinton also heldtalks with the top opposition leader Nawaz Sharif; parried questions from an audience of deeply suspicious collegestudents; met with civil society leaders including women and Pashtun elders; gave interviews to Pakistani journalists;and visited religious and cultural sights.She promised to refocus American aid on the ""needs of the people"" and announced targeted commitments including$85 million for microloans for poor women to start businesses and $125 million for the first phase of an electricityproject aimed at reducing blackouts and improving energy conservation.Those grants are welcome but still small change when compared with a five-year $7.5 billion ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ nonmilitary ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ aidpackage approved by Congress and signed into law this year. That package was supposed to demonstrate to Pakistanisthat this time the United States is in it for the long haul. Instead it has become another focus of popular resentment.The Army and some Pakistani news media whipped that up with disingenuous complaints that the legislation (Islamabadwas consulted beforehand) compromised Pakistan's sovereignty by conditioning disbursement on adequate civiliancontrol of the military.If Washington is ever to enlist Pakistan as a reliable ally it is going to have to do a much better job of explaining itself.And it is going to have to insist that Pakistan's leaders start explaining the real stakes to their citizens and the realbenefits of an alliance with the United States. Mrs. Clinton's trip was an important start ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ but only a start.",0

There are lots of things that we dealwith and come in contact with every day from alcohol to food to cigarettes a lot of the thingsthat aren't good for our health. But the American people ought to have the right to make thosedecisions on their own."" ...Schleifer: ""If you should become Speaker you could set a good example for the country bysaying 'I'm going to stop smoking.' Maybe you could get the President I understand he smokestoo maybe the two of you could find a way to try to stop smoking. That'd be kind of a goodthing wouldn't it?""I Boehner: ""Bob I appreciate your suggestion.""",0

"Good DayI am Mr. Patrick Chan, Executive Director and Chief FinancialOfficer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a concealed businesssuggestion for you.Our client Gen. Samir Abi Rahman who was with the Iraqi forcesand also businessman made a fixed deposit for 18 calendar months,with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand UnitedState Dollars only in my branch. Several maturities notices wassent to him, even during the war which began in 2003. Again afterthe war another notification was sent and still no response camefrom him. We later found out that the General along with his wifeand only daughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blastthat hit their home.After more inquiry it was also discovered that Gen. Samir AbiRahman did not declare any next of kin in his official papersincluding the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confidedin me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knewof his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four million Five HundredThousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and noone will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most isthat according to the laws of my country at the expiration of 5years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong KongGovernment if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against thisbackdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as aforeigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Samir Abi Rahmanso that you will be able to receive his funds.MODALITIES:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out sothat we shall come out successful. I have an attorney that willprepare the necessary document that will back you up as the nextof kin to Gen. Samir Abi Rahman. After you have been made the nextof kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf andsecure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favourfor the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in this matter, as we are goingadopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all thenecessarydocuments. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all mattersconcerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to yournominated bank account we shall then share in the ratio of 60% forme 40% for you.Should you be interested send me the following:1, Full names,2, private phone number,3, current residential address,And I prefer you reach me on my private email address below:(patrickchan202@yahoo.com.hk) and finally after I shall provide youwith moredetails on this operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr. Patrick Chan.",1

"Dear friend,This is a proposal in context but actually an appeal soliciting for your unreserved assistance in consummating an urgent transaction.By way of summarized profile of myself, I am Senator Luisa Pimentel Estrada, a 74years old lady and the first wife of Joseph Ejercito Estrada (former head of state and President of Philippines) who is presently held in detention in a hospital outside manilla,Philippines.However, the current administration of Gloria Arroyo(The President of Philippines) the present Government have resolved to freeze all known assets of Joseph Ejercito Estrada including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my Husband in Switzerland,UK and Australia. We cannot be held responsible for the sins of my Husband. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save our family from a hopeless future. And if you agree to help, we shall discuss the disbursement ratio in our next correspondence after we have been acquainted. In fact, the attack on our family (The Estrada's) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our traveling passport, family accounts, trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my Husband and even restrict us from seeing my husband.Ihave carefully moved out these funds (US$18 million), before my husband was impeached to an offshore Deposit Company.From past experiences, many people I had regarded as close friends has capitalize on my family's travail to run away with my money. In order to avert this negative development, I in conjunction with my son (DANIEL) now seek your permission to allow my attorney do a CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP/REASSIGNMENT OF CREDIT of stated funds from the deposit company to your name, so that the funds (US$18million) would be released to you as the new owner (on behalf of me and my family).In view of this grievous threat to our Economic and personal survival, our family trustee have secretly protected the deposit, you are to assist us to lay claims of the consignment with the aid of all legal documents that will be forwarded to you as time goes on.I am writing because when I deposited the money in the deposit company, I told them that it belonged to a foreign business partner and my present position will not allow me to claim the funds. Consequently, I will present you as the owner of the funds in the Deposit Company so you can be able to claim them. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately;1. Full names2. Contact address3. Telephone and fax numbersOnce I receive this information, we will prepare the necessary documents that will put you in place as the new owner of the funds. The money will then be released to your custody by the Deposit Company, for us to share. No doubt this proposal will make you apprehensive,please we employ you to observe utmost confidentiality and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because we shall require your assistance to invest our share in your country (buying of properties like houses, hotels etc). This is why your urgent action and response is of priority to enable us concluding this transaction in a timely and professional manner.Awaiting your swift response via this email address:lp4estrada@yahoo.co.in indicating your interest pls.Thanks and regards,Luisa Pimentel Estrada.",1

My<BR>late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich<BR>farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the<BR>ruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for his<BR>alleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition<BR>party. Before the death of my father, he took me to South<BR>Africa to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars<BR>($12m) with a security and finance company, as if he<BR>knew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was<BR>deposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid much<BR>dumourage from the security firm.<BR>This money was earmarked for the purchase of new<BR>machinery and chemicals for the farms and the<BR>establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.<BR>This land problem arose when President R. MUGABE<BR>introduced a new land Act. which wholly affects the<BR>White rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently<BR>condemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by the<BR>government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob<BR>actions.

Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law does<BR>not allow such investment hence I am seeking for<BR>an asylum or refugee.<BR>I must let you know tha! t this business is 100% risk<BR>free and the nature of your business does not<BR>necessary matter. So if you are willing to assist us<BR>claim the ownership of this money,I and my family have<BR>agreed to give you 20% of the total money, 40% will be<BR>for a joint business venture I will be doing with you<BR>and another 35% will be for me and my family which we<BR>shall also invest in your country and the remaining 5%<BR>will be mapped out for all expenses we may incure<BR>during the transaction.<BR>Therefor, if you are willing and interested to render<BR>the needed assistance.

"Dear :sirI am Mr.JACOB UDERIKE, an accountant of the standard trustbank Plc,Lagos Branch.I have urgent and veryconfidential business proposal for you. I got yourcontact from the world trade center (W.T.C.)regionaloffice in Lagos,Nigeria although the details of myintention was not made known to them.On June 6 1999, An American oil consultant/contractorwith the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,Mr.Trevor made a numbered time (fixed) deposited fortwelve calendar valued atUS$18,000,000.00(eighteenMillion Dorllars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I senta routine notification to his forwarding address butgot no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder andfinally I discovered from his contact employersNigerian National Petroleum corporation that Mr.Trevordied from an automobile accident. On furtherinvestigation, I found out that he did not leave aWILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin werefruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discoveredthat Mr.Trevor did not declare any next of kin in allhis official documents,including his Bank Depositpaperwork. This sum of US$18,000,000.00 is stillsitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolledover with the principal sum at the end of each year.Noone will come forward to claim it.According to theNigerian Law, at the expiration of 6(six) years, themoney will revert to the ownership of the NigerianGovernment if nobody applies to claim the funds.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as aforeigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Trevorso that the fruits of this old mans labor will not getinto the hands of some corrupt government officials.This is simple;1. I will like you to provide me immediately with yourfull names and address so that the attorney willprepare the necessary documents and affidavits, whichwill put you in place as the next of kin.2,your privet telephone and fax number for rasycommunication The money will be paid into your accountfor us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% foryou and 10% for the expencis that we are going to makeboth local and international during this processofthis transacation.There is no risk at all the paperwork for thistransaction will be done by the attorney and myposition as the Branch accountant guarantees thesuccessful execution of this transaction. If youare interested, please reply immediately via theprivate email address below.(jacobuderike@yahoo.com)Upon your response, Ishall then provide you with more details and relevantdocuments that will help you understand.Please observe utmost confidentiality, and restassured that this transaction would be most profitablefor both of us because I shall require your assistanceto invest my share in your country.Thanks and regards.Mr.JACOB UDERIKE",1

"AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION,AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK ( A.D.B )OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO,WEST AFRICA.Attention Please,I am Musa Garuba, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.The said amount was U.S$ 22.85M ( Twenty two million, eighty five thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when I hear from you.I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,Yours faithfully,Musa Garuba._________________________________________________________________Don't just search.

"A German man called Mr. Wolfgang Schiniter, 66 years of age and a prosperous farmer had deposited with us a sum of TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS(U.S.$20Million). His wife Mrs. Helga Schiniter is the legitimate beneficiary to this account. Unfortunately they were both killed in the air crash involving Concord AF4590 in Gonesse, France. Our serch through the german embassy to find any of the next of kin, have all proved fruitless. According to the embassy, the couple had no offspring. The Firm is still unrelenting in its effort to contact any of the relatives for possible claim of this money, or the fund will be transfared to the government cofferes. In order to avoid this development, my colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand as a distant relative to Mr. Wolfgang Schiniter so that the funds would be released to you. All the documents and proofs of identity to further enable you get these funds will be worked out. We ""the Firm"", have secured the order of mandamus fom the court to serch and locate any of the deceased relatives. This is why I am asking you to present yourself as the possible closest next of kin.I have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 30% of the total amount, I has also map out 10% for any expenses that might come during the process of the transaction, why 60% will be for me.  Upon my receipt of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me If your good self accsept to this request, I will then commence with the procuement of the necessary documents to back your claim as the next of kin. Thanks, we wait to hear from you. Yours sincerely MR JAMES TSHABALALA. ",1

"66 PLANTATION DRIVE,VICTORIA ISLAND LAGOS, NIGERIA. Dear Friend, I am a director in the foreign affairs department of the Nigerian National =Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). I got your email during a Personal research on =the Internet and wish to use this opportunity to notify you of the existence =of a certain amount we wish to transfer Overseas for the purpose of =investments and importation of goods from your country. In May 2003, a contract of sixty-six million United States dollars =($66,000,000) was awarded to a foreign company by my ministry. The Contract =was supply, erection and system optimization of supper polyore200,000-bpsd, =system optimization of 280,000-monax axial plants and the computerization of =conveyor belt for Kaduna refinery. With the Consent of only the head of the =contract evaluation department, I over Invoiced the contract value by thirty =four million United States dollars ($34,000,000:00). The contract has since been completed and the foreign company fully paid off. =But, in the office files and paper work, the company is still owed USD34M =representing the over invoiced amount. Because this amount is derived from =the award and execution of a foreign contract, there is no way the money can =be paid locally. That is why I am contacting you so that we can do the =project together for our mutual benefit. We have concluded every necessary =arrangement to transfer this amount to a foreign account as the final phase =payment for the said contract. I solicit your assistance to enable us transfer the said amount into your =safe bank account and after we shall come over there to share the money with =you. You can either provide us with an existing account or to set up a new =bank account immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve =to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end =of this important business trusting in you and believing that you will never =let me down either now or in future. We sincerely need an honest person to work with and have agreed to share the =money in the following percentages, 65% will be for us, 30% will be for you =whose account is used to secure the funds and 5% will be used to settle every =expenses incurred during the transaction like air tickets etc. There is no =risk involvement because applications will be made to the concerned Federal =ministries and parastatals with official approvals given by the Federal =government before the Central bank of Nigeria will be officially authorized =to wire the funds to your nominated bank account by telegraphic transfer. =Those involved over here are directors in the ministry, they know how best to =effect the transfer and will come over there to collect their own share. If you are interested, contact me via email indicating your full =names,company/business name and address. Your direct telephone and fax =numbers for effective communication. The name and address of the bank you =will like us to deposit the money, the telephone and fax numbers of the bank, =the account name and number etc. Everything has been arranged and I will send =more information about the business transaction to you as soon as I hear from =you. For obvious reasons, please keep the proposal top secret. Kind regards,Abraham Patrick  --9427ecdf-bbee-46bc-85a2-a8dca6d31521--",1

"Dear beloved,My name is Abdul Manoni, A Bahrain national,I have been diagnosed withOesophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment,and right now I have only about a few months to live, according tomedical experts. I have not particularly  lived my life so well,as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself) but my business.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was alwayshostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the onlything I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that thereismore to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in theworld. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to thisworld I wouldlive my life a different way from how I have lived it.Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my propertyand assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as afew close friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soulso, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I wantthis to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I haveDistributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Somaliaand Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot dothis myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one ofmy accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charityorganization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money tothemselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to becontended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which noone knows of is the huge cash deposit of Eighteen Milliondollars($18,000,000,00) that I have with a finance Houseabroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and despatch itto charity organizations.N/B:KINDLY NOTE THAT 20% of this funds must go to the tsunamivictims and another 10% for your effort and time.Regards.Abdul Manoni",1
"Rue 12 Avenue williamsville Abidjan,Republic of Cote D' Ivoire.Dearest My name is Miss Angela Kote. an orphan to the late former minister of finance in Sierra Leone Dr. Thomas kote who died as a result of rebel attack during one of their peace keeping forum in the year 2003. I inherited a total sum of $8.5 million US dollars from my late parents. This money which is concealed in a metallic trunk box is deposited with a security and finance company in Ivory Coast under a secret arrangement as a family treasure. This means that the security company does not know the real content of this box that was deposited in their security costody.My main purpose of sending you this mail is because of the way I found you and perhaps trustworthy to give this priority of shipping this box of money to any address that you think is very secured and safe in place with your percentage of which we shall chat on soon. I will come over to your country to continue my education as soon as the funds is claimed by you. There is need for urgent action because I am paying US $45 dollars per day as a demurrage charges to the security company for keeping this consignment. I give thanks immensely for the co-operation as I look forward to hear from you soonest.You can still mail me on this address angkote@yahoo.comBest RegardAngela Kote",1

"FROM THE DESK OF  PATRICE KONE (Esq).THE MANAGER IN CHARGE OF AUDITINGAND ACCOUNTING UNIT FOREIGNREMITTANCE DEPARTMENT OFDEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)OUAGA-BURKINA FASO IN WEST AFRICA.PLANE CRASH WEB SITE..http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm                        (""REMITTANCE OF $15 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS                          &nbs p;  CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE"")Compliment Of The Season,On a very good day. I am (PATRICE KONE  Esq),The Head of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search.When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we donÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.YourÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s faithfully,PATRICE KONE (Esq.)POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this business.______________________________________________________________________Je suis le directeur du bureau de changes ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ la BAD-burkina.

"FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ONLY). I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction which is of mutual benefit. I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporatio(NNPC). Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in NNPC by my Committee. This contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$21.5M. U.S. Dollars. This was done deliberately. The over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project. We now want to transfer this money which is in a suspense Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you to provide for us. ",1

"  PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.       I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr. Harry =Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he =died in the year2000. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief =illness that lasted for onlyfour days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his =death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my  matrimonial home =which the Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the =sum of$8.6Million (Eight Million six hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars) with one =finance/security company in Amsterderm Holland. Presently, this money is =still with the Security  Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would =not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my  stroke =sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church =or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I =am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund to fund =churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure  =that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that =Blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision because I don=92t have any child that will  inherit this =money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don=92t want my =husband=92s hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don=92t want a =situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the =reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know =where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. =Exodus 14 VS 14 says that  the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my =peace. I don=92t need any telephone communication in this regard because of =my health because of the presence of my husband=92s relatives around me =always. I don=92t want them to know about this development. With God all =things are possible.  As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the =contact of the Finance/Security Company in Amsterderm Holland. I will also =issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- =beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me =because the lord is my shephard.

Though I amvery rich, I was never generous, I was always hostileto people and only focused on my business as that wasthe only thing I cared for. But now I regret all thisas I now know that there is more to life than justwanting to have or make all the money in the world.Ibelieve when God gives me a second chance to come tothis world I would live my life a different way fromhow I have lived it.Now that God has called me, I have willed and givenmost of my property and assets to my immediate andextended familymembers as well as a few closefriends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept mysoul so, I have decided to give alms to charityorganizations, as I want this to be one of the lastgood deeds I do on earth.So far, I have distributed money to some charityorganizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia.Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannotdo this myself anymore. I once asked members of myfamily to close one of my accounts and distribute themoney which I have there to charity organization inBulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the moneyto themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, asthey seem not to be contended with what I have leftfor them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the hugecash deposit of Twenty Eight Million USD that I havewith a finance/Security Company abroad. I will wantyou to help me collect this deposit and despatch it tocharity organizations.I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.God be with you.DAVID ELLIS",1

"H: Assume you have seen the ""Petraeus briefing story"" or otherwise are familiar with its contents. In any case here it is. Itwas blazoned atop the Foreign Policy website the most widely read site on international affairs daily owned andpublished by the Washington Post. Below the piece is a note by its writer about his sourcing that appeared on a smallwebsite elsewhere. Also I've included an article by Max Blumenthal who spends his time on this issue and plans to moveto Israel for about 6-8 months to write a book. He tracks a lot of things that do not appear in the mainstream press. Sidhttp://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/03/14/the_petraeus_briefing_biden_s_embarrassment_is_not_the_whole_storyThe Petraeus briefing: Biden's embarrassmentis not the whole storyPosted By Mark Perry 4Saturday March 13 2010 -On Jan. 16 two days after a killer earthquake hit Haiti a team of senior military officers from the U.S. Central Command(responsible for overseeing American security interests in the Middle East) arrived at the Pentagon to brief Joint Chiefs ofStaff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The team had been dispatched by CENTCOMcommander Gen. David Petraeus to underline his growing worries at the lack of progress in resolving the issue. The 33-slide 45-minute PowerPoint briefing stunned Mullen. The briefers reported that there was a growing perception amongArab leaders that the U.S. was incapable of standing up to Israel that CENTCOM's mostly Arab constituency was losingfaith in American promises that Israeli intransigence on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was jeopardizing U.S. standing inthe region and that Mitchell himself was (as a senior Pentagon officer later bluntly described it) ""too old too slow ... andtoo late.""The January Mullen briefing was unprecedented. No previous CENTCOM commander had ever expressed himself onwhat is essentially a political issue; which is why the briefers were careful to tell Mullen that their conclusions followedfrom a December 2009 tour of the region where on Petraeus's instructions they spoke to senior Arab leaders.""Everywhere they went the message was pretty humbling"" a Pentagon officer familiar with the briefing says. ""Americawas not only viewed as weak but its military posture in the region was eroding."" But Petraeus wasn't finished: two daysafter the Mullen briefing Petraeus sent a paper to the White House requesting that the West Bank and Gaza (which withIsrael is a part of the European Command -- or EUCOM) be made a part of his area of operations. Petraeus's reasonwas straightforward: with U.S. troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan the U.S. military had to be perceived by Arableaders as engaged in the region's most troublesome conflict.[UPDATE: A senior military officer denied Sunday that Petraeus sent a paper to the White House.""CENTCOM did have a team brief the CJCS on concerns revolving around the Palestinian issue and CENTCOM didpropose a UCP change but to CJCS not to the WH"" the officer said via email. ""GEN Petraeus was not certain whatmight have been conveyed to the WH (if anything) from that brief to CJCS.""(UCP means ""unified combatant command"" like CENTCOM; CJCS refers to Mullen; and WH is the White House.)]The Mullen briefing and Petraeus's request hit the White House like a bombshell. While Petraeus's request thatCENTCOM be expanded to include the Palestinians was denied (""it was dead on arrival"" a Pentagon officer confirms)the Obama administration decided it would redouble its efforts -- pressing Israel once again on the settlements issuesending Mitchell on a visit to a number of Arab capitals and dispatching Mullen for a carefully arranged meeting with thechief of the Israeli General Staff Lt. General Gabi Ashkenazi. While the American press speculated that Mullen's tripfocused on Iran the JCS Chairman actually carried a blunt and tough message on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: thatIsrael had to see its conflict with the Palestinians ""in a larger regional context"" -- as having a direct impact on America'sstatus in the region. Certainly it was thought Israel would get the message.Israel didn't. When Vice President Joe Biden was embarrassed by an Israeli announcement that the Netanyahugovernment was building 1600 new homes in East Jerusalem the administration reacted. But no one was more outragedthan Biden who according to the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth engaged in a private and angry exchange with theIsraeli Prime Minister. Not surprisingly what Biden told Netanyahu reflected the importance the administration attached toPetraeus's Mullen briefing: ""This is starting to get dangerous for us"" Biden reportedly told Netanyahu. ""What you're doinghere undermines the security of our troops who are fighting in Iraq Afghanistan and Pakistan. That endangers us and itendangers regional peace."" Yedioth Ahronoth went on to report: ""The vice president told his Israeli hosts that since manypeople in the Muslim world perceived a connection between Israel's actions and US policy any decision aboutconstruction that undermines Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem could have an impact on the personal safety ofAmerican troops fighting against Islamic terrorism."" The message couldn't be plainer: Israel's intransigence could costAmerican lives.There are important and powerful lobbies in America: the NRA the American Medical Association the lawyers -- and theIsraeli lobby. But no lobby is as important or as powerful as the U.S. military. While commentators and pundits mightreflect that Joe Biden's trip to Israel has forever shifted America's relationship with its erstwhile ally in the region the realbreak came in January when David Petraeus sent a briefing team to the Pentagon with a stark warning: America'srelationship with Israel is important but not as important as the lives of America's soldiers. Maybe Israel gets the messagenow.Mark Perry's newest book is Talking To Terroristshttp://warincontext.org/2olo/o3/14/israel-is-putting-american-liyes-at-risk/My piece on the briefing of Admiral Mullen by CENTCOM senior officers has occasioned a great deal of comment aswell as some skepticism: how accurate is the account? Was it told to me by direct participants in the briefing? Isthere any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda whether that is a desire to expandCENTCOM ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ or even hostility towards Israel.I won't name my sources even though it's clear to people in the Pentagon ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ and certainly to General Petraeus ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ whothey are. Was I told of the briefing by the briefers themselves? I will only say that there were four people in thebriefing ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the two briefers Admiral Mullen and Admiral Mullen's primary adviser on the Israeli-Palestinianconflict. I know two of the people involved in the briefing. Whether or not they are my sources is something for thereader to determine. The account is not only accurate it's a precis of what actually happened. There is a lot more toit. The White House State Department and Pentagon have not denied the account and for good reason: it's true.Is there any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda in ordering the briefing?I have been reporting on the American military for thirty years. My work on the Joint Chiefs of Staff Four Stars isthe authoritative account on the subject. I have deeply rooted contacts in the military that go back thirty years. Ihave never met a senior military officer whom I do not admire. There is no greater insult than to believe that GeneralPetraeus or any other senior American military officer would use the lives of American soldiers as a lever to enhancetheir own political future. My sense is that General Petraeus neither likes nor dislikes Israel: but he loves his countryand he wants to protect our soldiers. The current crisis in American relations with Israel is not a litmus test ofGeneral Petraeus's loyalty to Israel but of his and our concern for those Americans in uniform in the Middle East.It is perhaps a sign of the depth of ""the Biden crisis"" that every controversy of this type seems to get translated intowhether or not America and its leaders are committed to Israel's security. This isn't about Israel's security it's aboutour security.http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/03/pastor-hagee-and-netanyahus-lovefest-on-eve-of-bidens-arrival-in-israel/Netanyahu and Pastor Hagee's Lovefest on Eve of Biden'sArrival in IsraelOn 03.09.10 By Max(Videos recorded by Rachel Tabachnick; more videos coming shortly.)Vice President Joe Biden was greeted in Jerusalem with the announcement that the Israeli Interior Ministry approved theconstruction of 1600 new homes in Occupied East Jerusalem contrary to U.S. wishes and complicating Biden's mission tohelp jump start the peace process. But Biden should have known that Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu intended to upset hisplans by Netanyahu's appearance with John Hagee.The day after a series of talks between US Special Envoy for the Middle East George Mitchell and Netanyahu and a daybefore Biden's arrival Netanyahu appeared onstage with Pastor John Hagee in Jerusalem. The occasion was Hagee'sNight To Honor Israel an event the far-right Texas-based preacher arranged to tout his ministry's millions in donations toIsraeli organizations and to level bellicose rhetoric against Israel's perceived enemies.At the gathering Hagee called Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ""the Hitler of the Middle East"" and denouncedthe Goldstone Report as ""character assassination by an unbiased and uninformed committee.""Netanyahu welcomed the crowd of 1000 American evangelicals to Jerusalem a city he described as ""the undividedeternal capitol of the Jewish people. Then he told them ""I salute you! The Jewish people salute you!"" He used the rest ofhis speech to call for ""tough biting sanctions"" against Iran that ""bite deep into its energy sector.""Hagee and Netanyahu appear together on stage:r--XIn the audience were top-level members of the Israeli government from Ambassador Michael Oren to Jerusalem MayorNir Barkat to Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon. Also present was Rabbi Shlomo Riskin the chief rabbi of the illegalWest Bank settlement of Efrat who gained notoriety for lobbying President Bill Clinton to pardon his friend fugitivebillionaire Marc Rich. Ayalon had stirred controversy days before when he refused to meet with a US congressionaldelegation brought to Israel by the progressive Jewish group J Street.Part One of Hagee's speech:XPart Two.XPastor Hagee in Jerusalem 3/8/10 (Part II) from Max J Blumenthal on Vimeo.Hagee's ceremony featured a 15-minute film highlighting the recipients of donations from John Hagee Ministries thattotaled $58 million since 2001. The recipients included Jewish settlements from the West Bank like Gush Etzion andShomron which was involved in promoting an ""Obama Hilltop project"" that promoted more settlement building andcompared Obama to Pharoah. Hagee also announced funding for a pressure group run by the settlers evacuated fromGush Katif in Gaza in 2005. During Israel's assault on Gaza in 2009 a group of Gush Katif residents lobbied the Israelgovernment to allow them to resettle the Palestinian coastal region.Who is Hagee funding in Israel?XWho Is Haoee Funding In Israel? from Max Blumenthal on Vimeo.The most notable of Hagee's funding recipients was an organization called Im Tirtzu. A student representative of thisgroup appeared in the film to thank Hagee for ""help[ing] us to ensure that students in Israel are on the right path the pathof Zionism the love of Israel the path of solidarity."" Another student called for ""the second revolution in Israel.""In February Im Tirtzu funding a smear campaign against former Knesset member and New Israel Fund Director NaomiChazan that included posters caricaturing her with a horn on her head. The group misleadingly accused the New IsraelFund of bankrolling 16 human rights organizations that contributed documentation to the Goldstone Report.The smear campaign led to unsuccessful legislation in the Knesset designed to further cripple already marginalized Israelihuman rights groups. Meanwhile the Jerusalem Post fired Chazan as a columnist without explanation. Gideon Levy acolumnist for Ha'aretz called Im Tirtzu ""a McCarthyite movement"" for its attacks on Chazan.Although CUFI attempted to distance itself from Im Tirtzu's campaign the organization's appearance during CUFI'sJerusalem ceremony suggested that Hagee would continue to provide it with funding well into the future.Republican Senator John McCain repudiated the endorsement of Hagee during his 2008 presidential campaign afterHagee's statements describing the Holocaust as a fulfillment of divine prophecy came to light. Hagee has also said thathe believed the anti-Christ was ""partially Jewish as was Adolph Hitler."" However none of Hagee's comments havedeterred Israeli government officials from embracing him or accepting his millions in annual charity.During Hagee's speech he made no secret of his support for the illegal settlement enterprise that has been the source ofdifficulties between the US and Israel. ""The settlements are not the problem"" he boomed from the podium. ""The problemis the refusal of Arab leaders to respect the right of Jewish people to live anywhere in the Middle East.""Hagee received a rousing ovation from the crowd and the Israeli government officials seated beside the podium when heproclaimed ""World leaders do not have the authority to tell Israel and the Jewish people what they can and cannot do inthe city of Jerusalem. They don't have the authority to tell them what they can and cannot build who can and and cannotlive there.""The following day on March 9 Vice President Joseph Biden arrived in Israel to meet with Netanyahu and officials fromthe Palestinian Authority. He told reporters after touching down that he saw ""a moment of real opportunity.""",0

"FROM:MR.GREG THAMBO.JOHHANESBURG- 2021SOUTH AFRICATEL:+27 73 077 5277RE-BUSINESS ENQUIRYDear Sir.I am Mr. Greg  Thambo  a South African and a senior civil servant  (General supervisor) with South African Gold and Diamond Mining and Processing  company Krugersdrop, the immediate younger brother to Mr. Oliver Thambo  (African National Congress- ANC) who  died in Johannesburg after a long  illness after  he returned to South Africa in 1990 following many yearsof  living in exile, including in Tanzania , Sweden.On the 24th April 1994, when apartheid was dismantled, the South  African  Government decided to compensate the families of all the Freedom  Fighters  who lost their lives during the struggle by placing the educated elites  in  high offices in South African Government.( KNOWN AS BLACK EMPOWERMENT  PROGRAMME HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA) among which my family was included. Forinstance, Nelson Mandela was compensated with being the first president of  the Republic of South Africa; Richard Parkes was appointed the manager  of  Shell and BP South Africa petroleum and refinery (S.A.P.R), Jeff Radebe  was   appointed the Minister of public Enterprises and Trevor Manual was  appointed  the Finance Minister.In fact, I got your contact / credibility from South African  information  exchange assisted by the south African Chamber of Commerce and Industry  where I however read your company profile believing in its reputable  capability as regards my intensive purposes to you.As a matter of fact, I have accumulated sufficiently USD$5 MILLION(Five  Million United States Dollars) by virtue of my position in the office  as a  senior civil servant in the South African Gold and Diamond mining  company  Krugersdrop.  Presently, this fund is absolutely kept in an insurancesuspense holding in a private security company in South Africa. The  deposition of this fund was made easier for me with a very strong written  agreement and signatory in a different beneficiary under my control.Being a South Africa serving civil servant, it is very difficult for me to  invest this fund here in my countryÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s the law strictly prohibits. If  the government got knowledge of it, the fund will be confiscated. I have no  doubt that you understand this point very well. This fund is my  struggle and  sweat through commissions from unaccountable contracts and other  profitable  additions from the companyÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s original cost price mostly gained from  customers around the world.Therefore, my plan and intention about this fund is to transfer it overseas into a straightforward, trustworthy and God-fearing personÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s less taxable  account for investment purpose only. Using your name/company as the  beneficiary of the fund to avoid my governmentÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s intervention. Last  time, Igot in contact with some one from South Korea but he became  unnecessarily  greedy concerning his commission in the deal before I decided to  contact  you.If you are interested in assisting me, please notify me immediately on  the above private telephone number or send me e-mail on my very  confidential  e-mail address. But if you are not in position to assist me, please  maintain  the high level of confidentiality needed in this Transaction.Yours Faithfully.Mr. Greg Thambo_________________________________________________________________Is your PC infected?

"Hello,I wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both of us. Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS. WEBSITE.http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm. I am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.According to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within seven years of the demise of the benefactor of the will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.Everything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for you and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami victims,as this is my primary objective. All I have to do is amend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.Again, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up. This is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if you decline my request.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Yours trulyStephen Ayling.     ",1

""The truth is thatPresident Obama is his own Henry Kissinger ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂno one else plays that role"" says a senior official.""Every administration reflects the personality ofthe president. This president wants all the trainsBarack Obama at the Great Wall of China last year. Unlike hispredecessor Richard Nixon who turned to Henry Kissinger foradvice the US president has no big foreign policy strategistrouted through the Oval Office.""Fifteen months after he took office the character and structure of Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery is still evolving.But from interviews with dozens of insiders and outsiders including senior officials both authorised and unauthorised tospeak and three former national security advisers it is clear the buck not only stops with but often floats for quite a longtime around Mr Obama himself.Foreigners have complained about the tendency of his domestic agenda to crowd out the international one ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the passagelast week of healthcare reform was greeted with an audible sigh of relief among US allies. But within foreign policy itselfhis centralised structure can also result in many issues being left on the back burner awaiting presidential attention saycritics.""On the positive side we have a very conscientious president who takes advice widely"" says the official. ""On the debitside for all the president's intelligence Barack Obama came to office with very little experience. He just doesn't havemuch depth on some issues.'The core of Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery is in the White House-based National Security Council which advisesthe president and co-ordinates activities across an increasingly complex alphabet soup of Washington departmentsmilitary commands and intelligence agencies. The most widely questioned link in the chain is Jim Jones whom to manypeople's surprise Mr Obama brought in as his national security adviser.Only briefly acquainted with Mr Obama beforehand General Jones a retired four-star marine corps general shows littleinterest in running the ""inter-agency"" process ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ a key part of the job. Somewhat unconventionally Gen Jones travelsfrequently and is thus often out of town. Unusually it is Mr Obama himself who usually chairs the weekly National SecurityCouncil known as the ""principals meeting"" not Gen Jones.Rahm Emanuel Mr Obama's chief of staff is also a key part of it. ""If you were to ask me who the real national securityadviser is I would say there were three or four of whom Rehm is one and of which Gen Jones is probably the leastimportant"" says another official.Anyone who has dealt with Gen Jones speaks highly of his matter-of-factness his geniality and the respect many foreigngovernments have for him ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Pakistan and Israel among them. But as he himself admitted rather disarmingly last year hedoes not have a taste for bureaucracy. Speaking at the Atlantic Council a think-tank where he previously worked GenJones provoked laughter when he said: ""I fondly remember [the Atlantic Council] as a place where people actually didwhat you asked them to do. In my new role I'm finding out that an order is a basis for negotiation.""The lack of a strong national security adviser has created recurring difficulties. Perhaps the best example is the Arab-Israeli peace process which Mr Obama launched on his second day in office when he appointed Geproe Mitphspil as hisenvoy. Three months later Mr Obama insisted Benjamin Netanyahu freeze all settlements activity in order to boost Arabconfidence in the talks.In a heated ;34.16NA(dpyin the Clvgli..0f7;ce. last May in which Mr Netanyahu refused to accede to Mr Obama's demand theonly officials present were Mr Emanuel and David Axelrod senior adviser to Mr Obama in office and during the campaign.Gen Jones was not there. The fallout put the talks in abeyance and damped high Arab hopes for Mr Obama.""The question is which bright spark advised the president to demand a settlements freeze without working out what thenext step should be when Netanyahu inevitably said 'No'?"" says Leslie Gelb an official in the Carter administration andformer head of the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Why wasn't George Mitchell in the room? Where was Jones?""Mr Obama's character is also stamped on the inter-agency process set up and managed by Tom Donilon deputynational security adviser. The nitty-gritty of foreign policy-making is done at these frequent ""deputies' meetings"" whichcan sometimes consume four to six hours a day.Described by one insider as ""the most powerful man in the White House whose name isn't widely known"" Mr Donilonwho was an official in the Clinton administration is the man who keeps Mr Obama's trains running on time. And there area lot of trains. Last year Mr Donilon held 270 deputies meetings ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ a workload described as ""clinically insane"" by a formersenior diplomat under Bill Clinton.But as time goes on it is becoming streamlined ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ now taking up roughly two to three hours a day say officials. ""Peopleforget that we inherited two wars terrorism threats and perhaps the biggest single eight-year decline [George W. Bush'stwo terms] in America's power and reputation in our history"" says a senior official. ""It took time to put in place a processthat could deal with the very complex decisions we had to take.""Also the organiser of Mr Obama's 9.30arn national security briefing Mr Donilon reinstated the paper trails needed toprevent intra-governmental anarchy using the model devised by Brent Scowcroft national security adviser to GeorgeBush senior and Gerald Ford. Vice-president Joe Biden's team was also incorporated to prevent the kind of ""parallelprocess"" Dick Cheney used to circumvent the bureaucracy under George W. Bush.""If you look for the 2002 or 2003 meeting where the decision to go to war in iraq was taken you cannot find it"" says thesenior official. ""By getting the process right we are improving the quality of decisions.""The deputies' ties go back years. For example the families of Mr Don;Ion and Jim Steinberg deputy secretary of stateoften go on holiday together. Mr Donilon's wife Cathy Russell is chief of staff to Jill Biden the vice-president's wife. MrSteinberg's wife Sherburne Abbott is deputy to John Holdren Mr Obama's chief scientific adviser.All those who regularly attend including Michele Flournoy a senior Pentagon official and Susan Rice the USambassador to the United Nations have known each other since at least 1993 when they started off in the Clintonadministration. This is just as well since they spend half their lives together: ""A lot of work gets done in that group"" saysMs Flournoy. ""Sometimes it feels like shovelling coal to keep the fires going.""The refurbished machinery was perhaps most in evidence during the build-up to Mr Obama's decision in December tosend another 30000 US troops to Afghanistan ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ a journey that took four months and involved him in 40 hours of OvalOffice meetings.But the very diligence of the process crowded out Mr Obama's time to focus on other crises ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ of which there are many.""Time is the most precious commodity a president has"" says a former national security adviser. ""On average he is onlygoing to have 45 minutes a day for foreign policy so you want to make sure it is well spent.""The widely expected departure of Gen Jones before the end of the year has also created rivalries within the engine room.Those who are thought to have ambitions to replace him include Mr Steinberg Ms Rice Mr Donilon and DenisMcDonough NSC chief of staff and the foreign policy official who is personally closest to Mr Obama. Although all arewidely respected none is considered a big strategic thinker in the Kissinger or Scowcroft mould.Described by Mr Gelb as Mr Obama's ""Lord High Executioner"" Mr McDonough ""has appended himself to the Chicagocrowd"" says another official. Mr McDonough's widely feared role highlights some of the contradictions of Mr Obama'sforeign policy apparatus.Once an adviser to former Senate majority leader Tom Deschle Mr McDonough was frequently at Mr Obama's sideduring the campaign. Insiders describe him as the ""enforcer"" and as the keeper of ""message discipline"" a key element ofany campaign but something that can drastically slow the wheels of government.""McDonough is the guy from the campaign and the one who plays basketball with the president ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ they're very close"" saysan official. ""Instead of Jim Jones telling McDonough what the president thinks it is the other way round.""Indeed if Mr Obama's highly centralised foreign policy machine had a face it would be Mr McDonough's. ""Donilon hasbeen perceived to make the process inclusive and give everyone a seat at the table"" says David Rothkopf a formerClinton official and scholar on the NSC. ""Fairly or not McDonough has been perceived as representing a process thatwas taking place in another room among the inner circle at a table to which most weren't invited.""Mr Obama has built a machine in which all roads lead to and from him. On the minus side that means a lot of lower-levelmeetings without decisions. It also means neglecting issues that cannot be squeezed into his diary such as trade policywhich continues to drift; or relations with India which are unnecessarily tense.And it means that the fingerprints of Mr Obama's political inner circle are detected by the rumour mill even when they areabsent such as on the president's decision to begin the rogg: witsirawal from anistan. in July 2011 ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ arecommendation that came from Robert Gates secretary of defence.On the plus side. Mr Obama has a sharp learning curve which means his administration continues to evolve. On the plusside also if it has to be White House-centric it is perhaps better with him as the Sun King than say Nixon or George W.Bush.""At the end of each meeting the president summarises what everyone has said and the arguments each has made with areal lawyer's clarity"" says a participant to the NSC principals meeting which includes Mr Gates and Mrs Clinton. ""Whenthe president finally makes a decision it is with the full facts and usually shows a high calibre of judgment.""When Mr Obama makes a decision that is.STATE AND DEFENCE DEPARTMENTSAn 'alliance of the unsackables' finds it can confront the inner circleIf there is a caveat to the depiction of the Obama administration as White House-centric it is in thealliance between Hillary Clinton and Robert Gates the president's secretaries of state and defence.Mrs Clinton has proved one of the surprises of Barack Obama's tenure forging a strong workingrelationship with her former rival and establishing herself as his chief foreign policy spokespersoninternationally ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ if not at home where Mr Obama's inner circle often seems to monopolise the explaining.Mr Gates who recently decided to stay for at least another year is seen as unsackable not least for thecredibility he lends on issues ranging from missile defence to Guantanamo Bay and Afghanistan. As aholdover from the Bush administration his national security bona fides are hard to dispute. It is nocoincidence that Mrs Clinton is probably the only other unsackable cabinet member.The combination has made itself felt in some of the administration's most significant debates notably onAfghanistan where both successfully urged the deployment of more troops.""Gates and Clinton happen to like each other which no one really predicted"" says one official who notesthat while the traditional role of the NSC is to ""play referee"" between the state and defence departmentsit is as often nowadays a combination of the two against the White House. This is very different from howit worked when Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell held those positions.""We work together well"" Mr Gates said at an appearance with Mrs Clinton on CNN last year. ""I think itstarts with frankly based on my experience the secretary of defence being willing to acknowledge thatthe secretary of state is the principal spokesperson for United States foreign policy.""Their outlooks often overlap. From the Pentagon Mr Gates has long called for more US spending ondiplomacy. As chief diplomat Mrs Clinton has adopted a muscular approach. On Iran both favour toughsanctions; on Russia both have sought to reassure Moscow's neighbours even while improving relationswith the Kremlin.But for all their workmanlike co-operation there is no escaping the fact that Mrs Clinton is not part of theObama inner circle ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ a traditionally helpful feature in that job. There is also a constant ""residue of friction""between Mr Obama's and Mrs Clinton's teams according to insiders. For example Cheryl Mills MrsClinton's chief of staff has had several run-ins with others in the administration.One official describes Mrs Clinton as ""totally loyal"" to Mr Obama. He adds: ""She and the president are notthe best of friends ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ how could they be? But she totally respects the presidency ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ she was married to apresident and she wanted to be one ... She still might be.""Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2010.

"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05orthern-ireland-police-powers-agreementBrown hails 'new chapter' in Northern Irelandas end to years of violencePromise of US investment follows 'momentous' agreement that seals power-sharing frameworkÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Henry McDonald Ireland correspondentÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ quardian.co.uk Friday 5 February 2010 19.11 GMTÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢XBritish and Irish PMs endorse power-sharing deal Link to this videoNorthern Ireland's leaders have been rewarded with the promise of a new US investment programme after securing ahistoric deal today which saved power sharing.Gordon Brown and his Irish counterpart Brian Cowen flew into Northern Ireland to put their seal of approval on the dealwhich will create a Department of Justice gives unionists concessions on the issue of Protestant parades and saves thepower-sharing executive from collapse.Brown said the achievements over the longest period of unbroken negotiations since the peace process began 16 yearsago were inspirational.""This is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence yearsof talks weeks of stalemate.""Tonight the White House said Barack Obama saw the deal as ""an important step to greater peace and prosperity for allcommunities on the island.""Obama would also meet Cowen the DUP leader and first minister Peter Robinson and the deputy first minister SinnFein's Martin McGuinness in Washington on St Patrick's Day next month.Earlier Hillary Clinton the US secretary of state said the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein was a ""shiningexample to other parts of the world locked in religious and ethnic conflicts"".As a result of the deal she said: ""The people of Northern Ireland are poised to build a thriving society on this strongerfoundation.Our economic envoy DecIan Kelly will continue to help Northern Ireland reap the dividends of peace including economicgrowth international investment and new opportunities. -In the near future Declan and I will host first minister Robinson and deputy first minister McGuinness in Washington.""The Irish prime minister said the agreement reached ""presents a real opportunity to renew the partnership which is the lifeblood of the devolved institutions. The people of Northern Ireland yearn for this constructive partnership to deliver tangibleoutcomes that improve their lives.""Referring back to the Belfast agreement of 1998 Gerry Adams the Sinn Fein president described today's agreement as""yet another good Friday."" After reaching an agreement just before midnight on Thursday the parties in the NorthernIreland assembly must now vote to put the compromise package in place. They will vote on 9 March to devolve policingand justice powers which will then create a justice ministry on 12 April ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ a key Sinn Fein demand throughout thesenegotiations.Under the agreement a six-member working group appointed by Robinson and McGuinness will formulate a frameworkfor handling contentious marches and the phasing out of the Parades Commission.The new body will encourage local people to find solutions to parading problems with the rights of marchers andresidents taken into account. It will complete its work within three weeks when the Northern Ireland executive will transferresponsibilities for parading legislation from Westminster and table a new bill based on the group's proposals.An executive working group will be set up in the hands of the SDLP and Ulster Unionists to improve the way the power-sharing cabinet is run. Robinson and McGuinness will address issues still outstanding from the 2006 St Andrewsagreement that led to the DUP-Sinn Fein deals. These include legislative measures to protect the rights of Irish languagespeakers.Ian Paisley Jr the North Antrim assembly member and son of the DUP's founder described the agreement as a ""win forunionism"".Paisley said his party had negotiated the end of the Parades Commission which most unionists regard as biased infavour of nationalists. He added that unionist critics of the deal had ""no alternative except the imposition of joint authorityfrom London and Dublin"".Mindful of attacks on the DUP by the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice Robinson said: ""There are some who will playpolitics with this agreement but the real focus in the months to come must be on building an administration at Stormontthat our whole community identifies with and supports.""Jim Allister the TUV leader and a former DUP MEP said he was ""relishing the prospect"" of a general election contestwith his former party. Allister will stand for the TUV in Ian Paisley Sr's North Antrim constituency.""In football terms I see this result as a five to one win for Sinn Fein. They get their date for policing and justice. Secondlytheir veto can be exercised over the justice ministry. They now have working party on Irish language. North/South bodiesare strengthened. And finally there is a stronger north-south parliamentary forum. The DUP only get a view of paradingissues.""Sinn Fein are laughing all the way to the next staging post"" he said.Shaun Woodward the Northern Ireland secretary said the deal was bad news for republican dissidents determined todestabilise the power-sharing government.He said a powerful message was being sent out to the dissidents that there are now ""two groups of people who were onceterrible rivals [who] have found a way through a very big challenge"".But the Real IRA Continuity IRA and Oglaigh na hEireann are unlikely to be moved by the accord at Hillsborough. In thepast seven days the republican dissidents have carried out three gun and bomb attacks on police stations acrossNorthern Ireland.Republican sources have told the Guardian that the groups are likely to intensify their armed campaigns when policingand justice powers are transferred to Belfast.",0

">From Mrs. Elena OwenLondon, W8 5DL,4 Kensington Court,England.I am Mrs. Elena Owen, a citizen of Bulgaria but I based in England, I am married to Sir Francis Owen who also is an Englishman though dead now. My husband worked with the British Railways for over two decade before the cold hand of death took him away on the 3rd of June 2005 at about 2:00AM our marriage lasted for over a decade without any fruit of the womb.My husband died after a protracted illness. My husband and I made a vow to uplift the down-trodden and the less-privileged individuals within the Europe, North and South America, Africa and the rest of the Globe as he had passion for persons who cannot help hemselves due to physical disability or financial predicament. I can adduce this to the fact that he needed a Child from this relationship, which never came.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $10.5 Million (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars in a dormant Account in one of the leading security and Finance company in Europe. this money is still with the Finance Company. Presently, am suffering from cancerous ailment for some years now. Recently, my Doctor told me that I have a limited or numbered days on earth and that my life Spam will not exceed 150days due to the cancerous problems I am suffering from.Though what bothers me most is the stroke that I have in addition to the cancer. With this hard reality that has befallen my family, I have decided to donate this fund to a non-governmental, or better still an individual, that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in., that will use this gift which comes from my husbands sweat to fund the upkeep of widows, orphans, destitute, the down-trodden, physically challenged children, barren-women and persons who prove to be genuinely handicapped financially. It is often said that blessed is the hand that gives.I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are Bourgeois and very wealthy persons and I do not want my husband hard earned money to be misused by his relatives whom have already sold all his landed property. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going.I know that I am going to be with the Almighty when I eventually pass on.The Almighty will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I do not need any telephone communication in this regard due to my deteriorating health and because of the presence of my husband relatives around me. I do not want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. I will want you to contact my personal attorney base in Manchester (U.K) on the information stated below, whom I have entrusted every detail regarding this fund.",1

Michele Flournoy and I also tied for no. 74 on the basis of our respectiveroles in the QDR and other reviews at DoD and the QDDR here at State. Here are the write ups13. Bill and Hillary Rodham Clintonfor proving that you don't need to be president to act presidential.FORMER PRESIDENT I NEW YORKSECRETARY OF STATE I WASHINGTONSpeaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in September Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded a confident note:""After years of war and uncertainty people are wondering what the future holds at home and abroad. So let me sayit clearly: The United States can must and will lead in this new century.""Ironically two of the people most crucial to the new global century are the Clintons themselves: the ex-president andthe ex-would-be-president the power couple now defined by their position just outside the highest reaches of power.Except that these days both Clintons are more influential and more beloved than ever. Bill's Clinton GlobalInitiative is starting to feel like a sexier more effective competitor not just to Davos but to the United Nations itselfbringing world leaders together to commit their resources to fighting poverty with market-based technocraticsolutions. As of this summer his foundation had contributed $23 million and countless man-hours to the effort torebuild Haiti. Polls have shown he's a better advocate for Democratic candidates than the actual president and hespent most of the fall stumping for woebegone Dems from Orlando to Seattle.Meanwhile Hillary showed up in one recent poll as the most popular political figure in the United States anaccolade she has earned through a no-drama approach to an array of thankless tasks: brushing off Vladimir Putin'stemper tantrum to reach agreement on nuclear disarmament and Iran sanctions promoting women's rights over theobjections of entrenched traditionalists and launching an innovative effort to bring clean cookstoves to the world'spoorest. But what she has mainly stood for is American competence with her Quadrennial Diplomacy andDevelopment Review a major if unglamorous step toward making U.S. statesmanship a more agile beast. If this iswhat Clinton nostalgia looks like bring it on.74. Michele Flournoy and Anne-Marie Slaughterfor setting the tone of how the United States engages with the world.POLICY PLANNING CHIEFS DEFENSE AND STATE DEPARTMENTS I WASHINGTONBarack Obama campaigned in 2008 on the promise of changing not just the style but the substance of how theUnited States deals with its allies and enemies abroad and the job of figuring out how to enact the changes felllargely to two people in particular. At the State Department Anne-Marie Slaughter director of policy planning isspearheading the department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The review aims to rejuvenatemarginalized civilian agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development preparing for a world inwhich America's worst threats are not great-power rivals but the upheavals associated with failed and failing states.Slaughter's Pentagon counterpart is Undersecretary for Policy Michele Flournoy co-founder of the Center for a NewAmerican Security think tank who articulated a vision for a new Democratic realism in foreign policy that bothcandidates Hillary Clinton and Obama embraced in the 2008 election. In 2010 she oversaw the Pentagon's ownquadrennial review a blueprint that cuts back on big-ticket weapons systems and focuses instead on the immediateneeds posed by today's asymmetrical conflicts. Flournoy has also been a vocal advocate for Obama's Afghanistanstrategy albeit a pragmatic one: ""I don't want to suggest that achieving success will be simple or easy"" she toldthe Senate in February. ""We need to prepare for the possibility that things may get harder before they get better.""Anne-Marie SlaughterDirector of Policy PlanningU.S. Dept(silent of State(202) 647-2972",0

"I've attached the gorgeous cover as a PDFHillary's Moment: Clinton Faces the WorldBy Joe KleinTime MagazineWednesday Nov. 04 2009It was Halloween night in Jerusalem and Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed as a peacemaker. ""We're prepared to startpeace talks immediately"" the notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed with U.S. Secretary of State HillaryClinton standing at his side poker-faced. ""I think we should ... get on it and get with it.""It was a ploy of course. The Palestinians were tangled up in themselves yet again. They had elections looming and theirleader Mahmoud Abbas had to hang tough: he was demanding a total freeze to Israeli settlement-building on the WestBank ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ which was precisely what the Obama Administration had previously said it favored. Netanyahu was offering apartial freeze not including new settlements in East Jerusalem the desired capital of a future Palestinian state. This wasa nonstarter for the Palestinians but it had the holographic glow of a step forward. It was an ""unprecedented"" offerNetanyahu trumpeted with the joy of a chess master springing a trap.(See photos from 60 years of Israel.)It was a tough moment for Clinton playing second fiddle at the Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama hadsoftened his language on the settlements a few weeks earlier: instead of a total freeze he had talked about Israeli""restraint"" in settlement-building. And now Clinton seemed to cement the Administration's retreat agreeing thatNetanyahu's proposal was indeed ""unprecedented"" even though the U.S. still favored a total freeze. The mostimportant thing she added was for the parties to get to the table as quickly as possible. The onus was back on thePalestinians ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ and the Palestinians quickly expressed outrage at the Obama Administration's retreat. Their Arabneighbors soon joined in causing Clinton to backtrack two days later telling reporters the Israeli plan ""falls far short"" ofU.S. expectations although she still insisted on calling it ""unprecedented"" which was neither diplomatic nor wise.Suddenly the Obama Administration seemed wobbly on the Middle East; clearly Clinton had been too bullish onNetanyahu's proposal (which had been negotiated over months with Middle East envoy George Mitchell and was seenprivately by the Americans as real progress). But the Administration's mission was to get the parties into peace talkswithout preconditions. The Israelis were now in favor of talks. The Palestinians were setting preconditions. And Clintonhad violated an essential rule of her job: boring is almost always better.(See photos from the life and career of formerSecretary of State Madeleine Albright.)Clinton's Three QualitiesFor the past 40 years the awkward Middle East press conference has helped define the job of Secretary of State. You goto Jerusalem or Ramallah; you stand there ""guardedly optimistic"" in public; in private you try to move a comma but theIsraelis or Palestinians move a semicolon to block your comma. The result is almost always the same: gridlock. Thebreakthroughs when they come emanate from others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat if he'd be willing to go toJerusalem ... and Sadat to everyone's surprise says yes. The Israelis and Palestinians hold secret meetings in Oslo andreach what appears to be a breakthrough ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ they're talking! ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ which then becomes another dead end.The job of Secretary of State is more thankless than glamorous; in some ways the Department of State a noble antiqueis still trying to come to terms with the invention of the telephone. In an era when Twitter haiku-messaging rulesdiplomacy moves at the speed and requires the nuanced complexity of literature. Power has drifted from State to theNational Security Council and the Pentagon especially in wartime. Only a few of Clinton's recent predecessors havedistinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger a National Security Adviser who belatedly became Secretary of State wasRichard Nixon's schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz was a strong policy voice in the Reagan Administration; JamesBaker had clout because he was George H.W. Bush's best friend and a world-class dealmaker. Most of the others havebeen frustrated or forgettable. And yet this is Hillary Clinton we're talking about ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the second most popular American inthe world an eternally compelling and supremely talented character the subject of constant speculation a walkingheadline. Her very presence in the job makes it crucial once more.It is a clichÃÂÃÂ© to say that by naming Clinton Obama brought his most popular potential opponent into the tent. Theconventional wisdom too cynical by half is that he thereby succeeded in neutering her a theory bolstered by Clinton'sreticence during her first nine months on the job with special envoys like Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke doing theheavy lifting of diplomacy. But by naming Clinton Obama also gave her great power which cuts both ways: if shebecomes dissatisfied with her role or the Administration's policies she can become a torpedo aimed at the Oval Office.Colin Powell had similar power and a real gripe ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the Iraq war ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ but never used it. Clinton has no such gripe but as theObama Administration settles in and policy differences begin to emerge among the key players the Powell conundrumlooms: How will Clinton choose to use her power? How will Obama react if and when she does?Traditionally the Secretary of State is judged on his or her ability to formulate policy negotiate deals and manage thestriped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton has no history as a global strategist although her performance in the 2008 campaignindicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonianidealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ although her performance in Jerusalemindicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling 101.There are however three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State. She brings a vision ofdepartmental reform ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacyÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold theoffice since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration which has enabled her to better understandand interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. But most important she is aninternational celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ second only tothe President's ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ to change negative attitudes about the U.S. abroad.She has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U.S. has fielded in quite some time althoughher performance so far at home and abroad has occasionally been perplexing. At home she has often seemedtentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early OctoberClinton's cautious formality took a backseat to Gates' brisk humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad she seemsfar more confident at times to the point of recklessness as in Jerusalem. (See photos of the last days of Hillary Clinton'scampaign.)Independence and CandorIn the last week of October Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage attempting at thebehest of her special envoys to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists into talks.In the course of the trip there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting herindependence as the Administration facing roadblocks across the world struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone afteran opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ ""Can't we all just get along?"" ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ phase.During her three days in Pakistan she ran a gauntlet of town-hall meetings and media interviews that may have beenunprecedented to use the word of the week for a U.S. Secretary of State. The trip planned by Holbrooke and Pakistanspecialist Vali Nasr offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit to a Sufi mosque that hadbeen bombed by Sunni extremists for example sent a powerful message to Pakistan's moderate Islamic majority. ""Wesaw her praying there"" an academic named Shala Aziz told me ""and for the first time I'm thinking The Americans havehearts.""(See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad.)The big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students talk-show hostsand Pashturi elders -- and that on occasion she pushed back raising incredibly sensitive issues like why no one in thePakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was even though he had been in the country since 2002. Pressaccounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State's getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton'sundiplomatic bluntness. But they missed the point: her candor her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticismhad begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U.S. as arrogant and bossy more interested in having thePakistani military fight its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership. The contrastwas especially sharp after George W. Bush's eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of PervezMusharraf. ""In the past when the Americans came they would talk to the generals and go home"" said FarahnazIspahani a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament. ""Clinton's willingness to meet with everyone hostileor not has made a big impression ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ and because she's Hillary Clinton with a real history of affinity for this country itmeans so much more.""Transformative ExperienceThere are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan because there is no alcohol. There are opening statements though andClinton's ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ was surprisingly emotional.Earlier in the day President Asif Ali Zardari the widower of Benazir Bhutto had presented the Secretary with an albumof photos from her first visit to Pakistan in 1995 and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton anddaughter Chelsea. ""It did bring tears to my eyes"" Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace""because I so admired your wife. She gave her life ..."" She faltered then choking up but quickly pulled herself togethertalking about the ""reasons why we do what we do ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ to provide opportunities for all.""Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in 1995 had been a transformative experience for her ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the beginning Ibelieve of theÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State. I traveled with her on that trip; whenwe set off she seemed depressed and even more private than usual. The Democrats had cratered in the 1994congressional elections and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan. It was a verypersonal defeat; as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan crowds shouted her down and cursed her.Privately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred. The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ it wasChelsea's spring break ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ but also a retreat to a more demure First LadyÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂlike role after two years as health care policyczar although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy had gone to India and famouslyridden an elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NGOs.""That was the greatest trip just unbelievable"" Clinton says now. We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after herJerusalem gaffe the Secretary in an electric-blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants. She was wearingglasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup. ""I guess that trip has animated and informed everything I'vedone since"" she said. She emerged from the trip reinvigorated with a new mission. By the end of 1995 at the U.N.Conference on Women in Beijing the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton Doctrine: ""Women's rights are humanrights.""(See photos of Beijing's changing skyline.)Clinton is not an easy interview. She is preternaturally cautious a consequence of her Methodist propriety and 20 yearsof insane public scrutiny. She does not like to talk about herself but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto.When her husband was governor of Arkansas she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outsideBhutto's hotel waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive. ""She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwarkameez with a chiffon scarf. I was just a fan standing on the sidewalk with everyone else. It was the only time I ever didanything like that"" Clinton says.When Clinton and Bhutto met formally on the first day of the 1995 trip they hit it off immediately in part becauseBhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember askingBhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past 25 years and she said ""I used to be ableto walk down the street wearing jeans without a headscarf. Now I can't."" When I asked her why she said ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ bluntly ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ""The Saudis"" who had been aggressively funding religious schools. Of course Bhutto's acquiescence to andparticipation in the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were soinadequate and madrasahs became popular. (See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto's assassination in 2007.)Ironically the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clinton's interests ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ microfinance education andhealth care ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ to the center of national-security policy for the first time. The impetus came not from the StateDepartment but from the military where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones -schools justice economic development ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ reinforce the military's efforts to secure the population. As a result therewas immediate chemistry between Clinton and General David Petraeus author of the Army's counterinsurgencymanual who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Atone point well before Obama made his presidential intentions known I asked Petraeus if there was any potentialDemocratic candidate who understood how his mind worked and he said ""You mean aside from Hillary?""It was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and Holbrooke (""my two alpha males"" she calls them) for the first time -at her home in Washington on the Friday before the Obama Inauguration. The affection and respect she gained for themilitary while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught thanusual ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ although Defense Secretary Gates' insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasn't hurt. Infact relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother at times than Clinton's relationship with the White House staff.Clinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAIDdirector Paul Farmer from getting the job. ""It was all sorts of niggling things"" says a Clinton adviser ""like Farmer hadat one point brought more than $10000 in cash into Haiti. The money was for a needle-exchange program but theamount was illegal.""Another of Clinton's military mentors retired General Jack Keane once told me ""I'm a Republican. I disagree with herabout practically everything but she'd make a hell of a Commander in Chief."" There is a palpable toughness to thewoman a hard edge that contrasts with the President's instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One of the sharpestexchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama accused Clinton of echoing the ""bluster"" of George W. Bushafter she said the U.S. would be able to ""obliterate"" Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Clinton's edgier tonehas been evident from the start of the Administration: she took a sharper position than the President on an Israelisettlement freeze by claiming in May that Obama wanted ""to see a stop to settlements. Not some settlements notoutposts not natural-growth exceptions."" And then in Jerusalem her use of the word unprecedented seemed arhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules.(Read ""Clinton's Collateral Damage."")The White House was not entirely thrilled with either statement. But then the White House staff is several stepsremoved from a negotiating process. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The Israelis have been difficult as always:whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister the Israeli stands up and walks out ofthe room. Despite Netanyahu's momentary tactical enthusiasm for peace talks his Likud Party has always favored thede facto incorporation of Palestinian lands into the state of Israel.Hillary's ChoiceThe tensions between the White House and State raise a fascinating question going forward. Obama and Clinton are insubstantive agreement on the President's diplomacy-first philosophy and on most policy issues ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ although neither iswilling to disclose the content of their private conversations ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ but style often predicts substance in foreign policy;neither Obama's gauziness nor Clinton's inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There is a growingperception that the Administration's policies have been thwarted across the board: Afghanistan is a mess Iran seemsready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations there's no progress in the Middle East the Syrians and North Koreans remainrecalcitrant the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense and the Chinese have been given a pass onhuman rights with no apparent quid pro quos.The White House argues that some progress has been made: Iran is on the defensive and North Korea has said it willreturn to the six-party talks. Clinton argues correctly about the need for ""strategic patience."" But the only thing Obamareally has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ no small thing ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the wisdom to haverefrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq. The President has been willing to use military force -the Predator drones that have decimated al-Qaeda's leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ but thisAdministration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of.U.S. power. That doesn't happenovernight but for Obama's policies to be considered a success it has to happen sooner or later in a way that can beexplained to the public.There is also a growing sense that the President's inexperience is beginning to show ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ not in his overall policy whichrepresents the views of a broad moderate national-security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to John Kerry butin his execution of the details. The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long; the Middle East peacehunt has become a wild goose chase. A letter to Iran's Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response;if it doesn't it seems weak and supplicatory. A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it isaccompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid. ""You can't be seen pushing countries around ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ demanding[that] Israel freeze settlements demanding that Hamid Karzai reform his government ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ and not get results"" says LeslieH. Gelb author of Power Rules. ""The leaders of these countries are tough successful politicians and they'll begin to takeyou less seriously."" (See photos from the 1979 revolution in Iran.)Clinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems and her staff is loath to admit her occasional mistakes. Her praisefor the President is fulsome and aides say the relationship with Obama really ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ really ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ is strong. But there are alsoburblings and emanations from Clinton's staff and friends Foggy Bottom body language that suggest there is a need forthe Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase. And the White House is perplexed by theuncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clinton's occasional overseas gaffes.These tensions are well within the boundaries of normal creative policymaking. There is absolutely no indication thatthe Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of NewYork as has been rumored. Quite the contrary she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State. To do thatthough she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad. She will have to become the President'sprimary foreign policy voice. Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration seven different Obama officialshave spoken on the Sunday talk shows about foreign policy. Clinton has been on each of the Sunday shows once. ""Eitheryou have one person sending the foreign policy message with the clear approval of the President"" says a formerRepublican Secretary of State ""or there is no message.""(See photos from eight months of Obama's diplomacy.)Aides to Obama say they would like to see her on the Sunday shows more often. (Indeed Clinton's staff acknowledgedthat she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so.) Ultimately though televisionis a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved: How much can these former rivals ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ both extremelyguarded and private people ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ really trust each other; and if not Clinton who will emerge as the President's alter egoon foreign policy? At this point the strongest member of Obama's national-security team is Gates ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ but he's aRepublican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Joneshas settled in as National Security Adviser but he's not a political animal ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ and every President needs a close foreignpolicy adviser who understands the intersection of long-term strategy politics and diplomatic chess.Clinton's value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan. She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioningthe $7.5 billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised. ""How much damage controlhave you been able to do on this trip?"" asked Meher Bokhari a television-news-show host at the end of Clinton'smeeting with Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question. ""I don't know"" shesaid. ""I hope some.""Afterward I asked Bokhari to answer her own question. ""Well this trip was long overdue"" she said. ""The Pakistanipeople really needed to talk to an American about our concerns ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the strings attached to aid programs the droneattacks their history of support for the military dictatorship. And it needs to be followed up. But if you ask me about thedamage control"" ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ she paused thinking it through ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ ""I'd have to say a lot. She accomplished a lot.""In the end though Clinton's success will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat.She will have to become a more sure-handed negotiator and most important a trusted adviser to a President whoknows where he wants to go in the world but hasn't quite figured out how to get there.",0

"Dr.Peter AkinjideIkoyi office complex,Lagos, Nigeria.Dear Friend,I am Dr.Peter Akinjide,on behalf of my colleagues from different FederalGovernment of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistanc=eas regards transfer of US$41,500,000.00 (Fourty one Million,five HundredThousand US Dollars)into your bank account. These funds emanated from unc=laimedcontractual proceeds of foreign contracting firms who could not meet thei=rfinancial obligations to their creditors. We, as holders of sensitive pos=itionsin our various parastatals, were mandated by the Federal Government to sc=rutiniseall payments made to certain foreign contractors and we discovered thatsome of the contractors have not been paid their contractual entitlementwhich collectively left the sum of US$46,500,000.00 (Fourty six Million,f=iveHundred Thousand US Dollars) lying in a suspended Account.However,from our investigations,we discovered that the foreign beneficiar=ycompanies have since been liquidated, and to all intents and purposes nolonger exist in Nigeria, thus providing us with this opportunity,provided that we have a capable partner, to execute a transac=tionof this nature.We agreed that the said amount would be transferred into an overseas Bank=Account to be provided by a reliable foreign firm/associate. This is beca=useas serving Government workers the Civil Service Code does not allow us to=operate foreign Account. In our initial attempt to do this,we succeeded in transferring part of this amount US$5m (Five Million=Dollars)into a United States Dollar Account in Beirut, Lebanon, but ourforeign associate failed to honour our mutual agreement insisting instead=that the total amount be transferred into the Account before we can share=the money.As a result, we have lost confidence in the ability of our Lebanese partn=erto see this matter to its logical conclusion,and until the initial transa=ctionis satisfactorily resolved,we have cancelled further transactions with hi=m.Inthe light of the foregoing,it is clear that we require a partner that is not only capable of rendering assistanc=eand cooperation in executing this matter, but will honour the terms of ag=reementwhen we reach the concluding stages of this transaction.We therefore offer the amount of 20% of the entire sum in return for serv=ices/assistancerendered in successfully carrying out this project.We trust that you appr=eciatethe sensitive nature of this matter and the need for initial caution onour part, but when a relationship is confidently established and operatio=nscommence you will be provided with all relevant information.I remain at your disposal to entertain any questions/enquiries relatingto this proposition and you may contact me as a matter of urgency via e-m=ailfor further information on the procedures and requirements of this transa=ction.Inyour reply, remember to indicate a safe telephone number where I can alwa=ysreach you.

He went to London with his family yesterday to visit his wife who is ina clinic there apparently.Empey still not on board apparently so the ""community confidence"" round may be used to put pressure on him to do so.Our intervention on Thursday night/Friday morning was seen as a very important moment/catalyst.

Dear Secretary Clinton:I am a Professional Member of the American Society for Industrial Security andthe American College of Forensic Examiners; I have guest lectured and taughtindustrial security management homeland security port and harbor security andcritical incident response management.As elated as everyone is over the splendid outcome of the Maersk Alabamahijacking case as I had predicted in today's news it is reported that fouradditional vessels were attacked and now Terrorists are holding some 60 hostages.Before anyone does anything regarding Somalia may I make the followingcomments and observations.What is going on in the Gulf of Aden is as an organized criminal enterprise forprofit. There are some 250 hostages being held and they are being kept as well asthey can be under the circumstances because the terrorists are expecting a paydayout of this. As soon as they see any form of direct Military action in the northeastat the mouth of the Gulf of Aden I can assure you more Americans will beabducted and we will see another series of video beheadings under a Democraticwatch.I would recommend that the Secretary encourage the United Nations to create anInternational Maritime Security Working Group. Since the Shipping Industry hasalready absorbed something like Fifty Billion Dollars regarding the various piracyincidents in 2008 alone; they have the resources to contract privatesecurity/military contractors who could work onboard merchant shipping inInternational Waters.Secretary Hillary Rodham ClintonApril 14 2009Page 2 of 2.They could rotate from the northern edge of the threat envelope to the southernend and take direct action on a case-by-case basis.

ButState's role in the conceptual planning of the trip was not central and the department's senior Asia hand Kurt Campbellsurely knew better. It's also hard to tar the National Security Council's own senior Asia expert Jeff Bader another pro likeCampbell. Perhaps even higher officials at the NSC dropped the ball. Perhaps Mr. Obama might take responsibilityhimself as President Kennedy did after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961. Now that would truly clear the airÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂand open thedoor to some obvious and necessary changes in the administration's decision-making machinery. Every decision largeand small is shaped and made by the president himself and enforced by Denis McDonough a deputy NSC adviser andthe administration's Lord High Executioner. Does Obama get enough pushback? Is he hearing a range of views? Can hesee that his powerful intellect might profit from bowing to the voices of experience? If Mr. Obama reflects on the Asiajourney and other mishaps he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as insidecounselors or outside advisers.Amateur Hour at the White Houseby Leslie H. GelbNovember 22 2009 I 10:50pmThe Asia trip was not worth Obama's time. Leslie H. Gelb on why the president should shake up hisforeign policy teamÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂand make sure the deals are done before he leaves home.President Obama's nine-day trip to Asia is worth a look back to fix two potent problems past and future. First the trip'slimited value per day of presidential effort suggests a disturbing amateurishness in managing America's power. On top ofthe inexcusably clumsy review of Afghan policy and the fumbling of Mideast negotiations the message for Mr. Obamashould be clear: He should stare hard at the skills of his foreign-policy team and more so at his own dominant role indecision-making. Something is awry somewhere and he's got to fix it.Secondly the Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world'smost dynamic economic region and Mr. Obama missed it. He only scratched the surface in his calls for multilateralismand mutual understanding. He needs to paint pictures of how Washington will help solve regional security and tradeproblems. Otherwise most Asian nations will continue their unwanted drift toward China and away from the United States.A meditation on his journey should start by forgetting half of the last week's commentary. Unbelievably some criticizedObama for not getting China to ""throw its weight around."" What Asian leaders want that? None that I know of. Otherslamented that Obama couldn't make ""demands"" on China anymore. The presumption here is that China is now king andthat Washington can no longer have its way with Beijing. The facts are that Washington never did boss Beijing aroundand that China is not now ruling the roost (more accurately it's sitting on its own eggs). Others contended that Obamacontinued his pattern of trashing America's friends and coddling its authoritarian enemies like China. It's hard to stomachthis nonsense from the same conservative crowd that forever praised George W. Bush for accommodating China andalienating America's allies.Some analysts played fair and acknowledged that administration officials tried to tell reporters not to expect ""deliverables""on the trip and to see the journey more as a recognition of Asia's new importance and America's desire for a new co-operative spirit. That's a commendable thought but hardly justification for almost two weeks of the president's time (whenyou consider preparations)ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ especially when he's got a tanking economy health-care reform woes and decisions tomake on Afghanistan. Presidents take trips like this one only when they need breakthroughs and accomplishments oncertain issues that can't be agreed on without the pressure of an impending presidential visit. In fact most presidentswouldn't even commit to trips abroad without knowing that key deals would be finally agreed on and announced during thevisit itself. The prospective visit is the power jackhammer to nail down the deals. Just take a gander at trips planned forRichard Nixon by Henry Kissinger or for George H. W. Bush by James Baker.Obama's travels were a chance to settle or make concrete progress on thorny issues like greenhouse-gas emissions andthe fate of U.S. bases on Okinawa which the new Japanese government insists on moving. It was time to announce waysto gain fixes on the U.S.-South Korean trade treaty long stalled in Congress. It was a moment to show that Beijing wouldactually make some mutually beneficial compromises on exchange rates or economic sanctions against Iranian and NorthKorean nuclear programs. Absent guarantees of progress on issues such as these Mr. Obama should have taken a well-deserved vacation in Hawaii.Matters were made worse on the scene. It was not good optics for Obama to bow to Japan's emperor. He seems to dothis stuff spontaneously and inexplicably as with his bow to the Saudi King some months ago. And it was truly unfortunatethat Obama and his aides didn't flatly insist that he be allowed to address the Chinese people directly on television andmeet with non-stacked Chinese groupsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂas has been the case during previous presidential visits. Beijing's leadersobviously didn't feel confident enough of their own standing at home to give the popular Mr. Obama such access. But heand his team should have made it a precondition of the visit. Its absence left an unhappy taste.The Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world's most dynamiceconomic region and Mr. Obama missed it.The White House might try to blame the State Department (such an easy and delicious target) for the missteps. ButState's role in the conceptual planning of the trip was not central and the department's senior Asia hand Kurt Campbellsurely knew better. It's also hard to tar the National Security Council's own senior Asia expert Jeff Bader another pro likeCampbell. Perhaps even higher officials at the NSC dropped the ball.

If Mr. Obama reflects on the Asiajourney and other mishaps he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as insidecounselors or outside advisers.If most Asia hands inside and outside the government had designed the Obama trip here's what they would haveadvised: Go beyond the usual and trite message of building mutual understanding and cooperation and stop invoking theGod of Multilateralism without spelling out America's leadership role. Asia is now overflowing with multilateralorganizations. Washington is a member of a few key ones like Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the AsianDevelopment Bank. But that has little to do with other new and key groupings such as the Shanghai CooperationOrganization (Russia China Uzbekistan etc.) and ASEAN the association of Southeast Asian nations. Asian nations areincreasingly organizing themselves into these groups and Washington hasn't really figured out its role. Most Asiannations want that role to be a prominent oneÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂin fact the leadership position. They're afraid of China afraid that Chinawon't be as attentive to their concerns in the future as America was in the past. At the same time they don't wantWashington to come into these groupings and cause problems with Beijing. They want Washington to figure out aleadership position constructed on the proven American ability to help solve common problems in the common interest.They want an America they remember one that can get things done and doesn't let problems fester.That U.S. policy was the main missing ingredient on Obama's trip. Washington played architect and solidified itsleadership in Europe after World War II with NATO the Marshall Plan and various trade and economic organizations likethe World Bank. Asian nations are yearning for the same kind of creativity today from a brilliant American president in thenew Pacific Era.Leslie H.

" I am Mrs.Mable Kabila, from Democratic Republic of Congo. There is an imformation I would like you to keep very confidential There is sum ammount of money my Husband Late President Laurent Kabila, deposited in a security company Abidjan Cote d'ivoire for safe keeping. Before he was killed by his Eldest Millitary Son. The squable happened as immediately we returned back from our London trip. My husband married us two.I am the second wife.I will not be able to give you the full details that led to that urgly incidents.The Eldest Son is the current President of our country now. For now I am staying in Abijdan, the capital of Republic of Cote d'voire,just to save my life,with my three children. The money in question, is 22, Million U.S.Dollars. I can not make the withdrawal of this fund, because my husband registered the Beneficiary of the fund as his (Foriegn Bussiness Patner) and also (Family valuables as the content of thedeposit) The documents of the deposit are with me.What I would want you to do, is to assits me to get the consignment withdrawn from the security company, and we shall open a small account in a Bank here in your name, and transfer the money to your country, through the account .We shall replace the name Foriegn Patner to your own name, because the code was used for security reason. I will give you the 10% of the money for your assitance.Ther is no risk in this transaction. I will use the remaining balance of the money for an investiment in your country for the future of my children.If you are intrested, and can maintain the very confidential of this transaction,you e-mail meimmediately for more clearification, and also note that I am a refugees in Abidjan, Cote dÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ lvoire becuase of the assasnation of late husband,and the civil war going on in our country,Democratic Republic of Congo. contact me in my private Thank you very much and God bless you.Mrs.Mable Kabila.- mrs.mable kabila",1
"Let me start by introducing myself. I am MR. MARK ELLIS, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER of the CITY CENTER TRUST BANK.I have an obscured business suggestion for you.I honestly apologize and hope I did not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium, sorry my English is not very good. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client MAJOR FADI EL AMIN who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Ten millions United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several Notices was sent to him, even during the war early this year.Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that MAJOR FADI EL AMIN did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Ten millions United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the England Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to MAJOR FADI EL AMIN so that you will be able to receive his funds.Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you. Should you be interested please let me know and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.",1

In this account, he has (Thirty-nine Million Dollars) $39,000,000 only, which was credited in his favour.In my husband's 'WILL' he stated that one of his partners overseas will take care of his family/properties.

"Hello,My name is DAVID ELLIS, a nationality of UnitedKingdom,I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer.It has defiled allforms of medical treatment, andright now I have only about a few months to live,according to medical experts.I have notparticularlylived my life so well, as I never really cared foranyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I amvery rich, I was never generous, I was always hostileto people and only focused on my business as that wasthe only thing I cared for. But now I regret all thisas I now know that there is more to life than justwanting to have or make all the money in the world.Ibelieve when God gives me a second chance to come tothis world I would live my life a different way fromhow I have lived it.Now that God has called me, I have willed and givenmost of my property and assets to my immediate andextended familymembers as well as a few closefriends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept mysoul so, I have decided to give alms to charityorganizations, as I want this to be one of the lastgood deeds I do on earth.So far, I have distributed money to some charityorganizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia.Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannotdo this myself anymore. I once asked members of myfamily to close one of my accounts and distribute themoney which I have there to charity organization inBulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the moneyto themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, asthey seem not to be contended with what I have leftfor them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the hugecash deposit of Twenty Eight Million USD that I havewith a finance/Security Company abroad. I will wantyou to help me collect this deposit and despatch it tocharity organizations.I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.God be with you.DAVID ELLIS",1

"Mrs.Rose ObasekiFlat 8 Block 12 NNPC QuartersGarki Abuja Nigeria.Dear  Friend,I presume this letter will come to you as a surprise, butasthings unfold, we will know each other better. I will startbyintroducing myself to you.I am Mrs. Rose Obaseki, the wife of Chief Jackson GraciousObaseki, the Managing Director, and Chief Executive,Nigerian NationalPetroleum Corporation (NNPC). I am really sure that youwill be of agood assistance after going thoroughly through this letter.For many years of marriage now between me and my husband, Ihavenot given birth, and this has really troubled my husband.As a result of the respect given to local tradition culture and customhere in Nigeria,my husband has decided to break the marriage. Withthe situation of thingswith me now, my matrimonial home look bleak. I am beenthreatened dailyby my husband to get out from the home. My Husband sbrothers are notleft outin this matter. This situation has really affected me psychologically.As at now, I am no longer Assured of a matrimonial home,hence I seekyour urgent assistance and help which I know will go a longway in getting me settled finally.I want to use this opportunity to move the sum of(US$29.5M) intoyour custody for safe keeping, pending my arrival in yourcountry. Thissaid amount was given to my husband as gratification fromsome Foreign OilCompanies he helped in getting Allocation for the Drillingof Crude Oilin Nigeria.As a civil servant, he does not want to be exposed, hencehegave me this money to keep in my personal account so thathe can beexonerated from the eyes of government security operativesand the Civil Service Commission (CSC) which is a body thatscrutinizes the activities of allcivil servants in Nigeria as checks and balances forofficialmisconduct. Be informed that this money is not connectedwith drugs; money laundry,firearms and looting which I believe will put fears in youto render the required assistance needed from you and consequentlywithdrawing your help forsecurity reasons.Hence the source of this said money is clean and clear.This money was deposited in my personalin name, andthere is no way it can be transferred telegraphically underthe bankingprocedures which could have been the easiest, but becauseof monetarytransfer restriction by the Federal Government of Nigeria,that isdefeated. Rather I have arranged a diplomat manager to movethis money out in cash to anydestination where it will be easy for you to collect underdiplomaticimmunity.This he has assured me of. As a soon as I see your responseandwillingness to help as regards to this, I will furnish youon the next line ofacti onto take, but be rest assured that this transactionis 100% risk free,and my husband will not raise any alarm because he will notlike to puthimself, his job and office in jeopardy, and if he does, hestands thechange of loosing his job.As soon as this money is moved to you, and you confirm tomethat you have received it, I will be coming to meet you upthere in your country where I wish to live the rest of my life. Iwill be offering you 25% of this money for all your help at this time ofneed, while somepercentages has been  set aside for my Brother tocomplement his efforts here. Beinformed that this transaction will not last more than 14working daysand it will be concluded because every arrangement has beenput in place.Your negative or positive response will be highlyappreciated.Yours faithfully,Mrs. Rose Obaseki ___________________________________________ Look Good, Feel Good www.healthiest.co.za",1

"Dear, By way of introduction I am Mr.Idris Umar working in the credit and accounts department Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Lagos, Nigeria. I write you in respect of a foreign customer with Domiciliary A/C number 6402356789. His name is Engineer Joseph Schultzman. He was among those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria during the reign of late General Sani Abacha. Since the demise of this our customer, Engineer Joseph Schultzman, who was an oil merchant/contractor, I have kept a close watch of the deposit records and accounts and since then no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as next of kin to the late Engineer. He had only $38.5mllion in his a/c and the a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the code or password of the deposit particulars. As it stands now, there is nobody in that position to produce the needed information other than my very self considering my position in the bank. Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your co operation in using your name as the next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself and you. At this point I am the only one with the information because I have removed the deposit file from the safe . By this doing, what is required of you is to send an application laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to the late Engineer. I will need your full name and address, company or residential, so that i can computerize them to tally with next of kin column in the certificate of deposit. Finally I want you to understand that the request for a foreigner as the next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a local cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me, then we shall discuss on how the money will be split between us. Trusting to hear from you, I remain Respectfully yours, Mr. Idris Umar.

This draft sounds didactic. That's ok in terms of substance--as far as I know--but it reads like an automatic weaponwhich may be inevitable since there's so much material to cover. I just want to be sure the facts are right.,0
"in Nigeria, this committee awarded a contract of US$400 Million to a group of five construction firms on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Aviation (FMA)for the supply and installation of landing and navigationalequipment in Lagos and Port Harcourt International Airports. During this process my colleagues and I decided among us to deliberately over inflate the total contract sum of US$420.5 Million with the aim of sharing the remaining sum of US$20.5 million.The government has since approved the sum of US$420.5Million for us as the contract sum, but since the contract is only worth US$400M the remaining US$20.5 Million is what we intend to transfer to a reliable and safe offshore account,we are prohibited to operate foreign accountin our names since we are still in Government. Thus, making it impossible for us to acquire the money in our name right now, I havetherefore been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues to look for an oversea partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of US$20.5Million.Mycolleagues and I have decided that if you/your Company can as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of thetotal amount (US$20.5Million) while 75% will be for us (officials) and the remaining 5% will be used in offsetting all debts/expenses incurred during thistransaction We have decided that this transaction can only proceed under the following condition(a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and that you treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality(b) That upon Receipt of the funds you will release the funds as instructed by us after you've removed your share of 20%. Please acknowledge the receiptof this letter using the above e-mail address. I will bring you into the complete of this transaction when I've heard from you.Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we are already behind schedule for the financial quarter.

It is way too long and something of a hybrid having started out as a bigpolicy speech in advance of the summit. Now it is a town hall one day before the POTUS outlines his agenda atthe intervention. My suggestion is that you review this long draft which covers a lot of ground (though noteverything). In the meantime I'll work on an abbreviated version that focuses on your main themes -- theurgency of our working together with other countries to narrow the income gap and reduce poverty by creatinga safety net of education food security and public safety that unleashes the full potential of the people andnations of our Hemisphere.,0

"The Secretary's Phone Call with Egyptian President MubarakBackground: S/E Mitchell met with Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit and EGIS Chief Omar Solimon on January 24 in Cairo.While Solimon responded positively to S/E Mitchell's request that Egypt encourage Palestinian President Abbas to agreeto proximity talks Aboul Gheit asserted that the Palestinians should not agree to any form of negotiations until Israelhas taken action on the ""five steps"" requested by the Palestinians. Aboul Gheit then hosted a meeting on February 3with Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Jordanian FM Nasser Judeh which Solimon attended in part. Egypt andJordan agreed to support the Palestinians entry into proximity talks but the three sides also agreed that Abbas wouldseek U.S. views on two questions: 1) The terms of reference for the proximity talks and 2) Whether the U.S. wouldpresent its own bridging proposals on final status issues or simply serve as a conduit for the parties' positions. DeputyEnvoy David Hale met with Abbas on February 5 during which Abbas indicated flexibility on both the terms of reference(he would accept a general formula based on language from the Roadmap) and on the U.S. role. You should emphasizethat it is critical that Abbas agree to begin proximity talks immediately to lay the foundation for negotiations that willrealize Palestinian aspirations for an independent and viable state.",0

There were series of contractsexecuted by a consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in favor ofthe Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation (N.N.P.C.) the original value ofthese contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum ofUSD$25,000,000.00 (twenty five million united state Dollars).This amount has been approved and is now ready to be transferred being thatthe companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paidand the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and Iare willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequentdisbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code ofconduct bureau (civil Service law) from operating and/or opening foreignaccounts in our names.Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, inreturn, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10%shall be set aside for Incidental expenses (internal and external) betweenboth parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remitthe balanceto other accounts in due course.Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry offinance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of thefunds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the abovestated terms.our assurance is that your role is Risk free and to accord this transactionthe legality It deserves and for mutual security of the funds the wholeapproval procedures will be officially and legally processed with your nameor the name of any company you may nominate as the bona- fide beneficiary.Once more I want you to understand thathaving put in over twenty five years in the civil service of my country, Iam averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should thereforebe treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves.Please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a faxon my confidential fax number ( 234 17 597626) or mail to private emailaddress,so that I can brief you further. I want to assure you that thisbusiness proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our homework properly.I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this dealstrictly confidential, as we are still in government service, which weintend to retire from. Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule toenable us include this transfer in the first batch which would constitutethe second quarter payments for the 2003 financial year.Thanks and God bless,Dr.Kunle Owolo.",1

"Friend in the Lord,Please use this money for the churches and less privileged.Greetings to you and your family in the name of God. In my search for a reliable and God fearing person and having gotten your contact through prayers and painstaking efforts I have decided to seek your help in carrying out my last wishes. My name is Mrs.Marvis Smith. I'm a 65 years old woman and from Congo. I was a merchant and owned two businesses in Dubai. I was also married with two children.My husband and two children died in a car accident six years ago. Before this happened, my business and concern for making money was all I live for. I never really cared about other values in life. But since the loss of my family, I have found a new desire to assist helpless families. I have been helping orphans in orphanage/motherless homes. I have also donated some money for humanitarian needs in Sudan, South Africa, Cameroon, Brazil, Spain, Austria, Germany and some Asian countries. Only recently I saw on television the colossal loss of properties and livelihood people in Canberra, Australia through fire.I was moving with great pity and compassion that I decided to make this contribution on assisting people over there, I kept $US25,000,000.00 Million in a long-term deposit account in a Finance company. Presently, I'm in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for oesophagi cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only few months to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to victims of the fire outbreak in Australia and other charity organization. Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them.Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me collect the deposit and  distributes it accordingly. Use your judgment to distribute the money and keep 20% of it to yourself. Feel free to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you incur during the process of collecting and distributing the money. If you are willing to help, please reply as soon as possible. May the good lord bless you and your family.Please, send reply and all correspondences to my attorney :Barrister. Lamo benson",1

"In order to transfer (USD$56 Million Dollars) from our bank, I have the courage to ask you to look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable of this important business believing that you will not me down. I am MR. MARTINS AKUthe eastern district bank manager of united bank for Africa plc (UBA). There is an account opened in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has operated on this account again. After intensive investigations, I discovered that if I do not find a way to get the amount in question stacked out somewhere safe urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account, ENGR. SMITH U. WILLIAMS, a foreigner, the manager of Petro- technical support services, a chemical Engineer by profession and he died in 1990 and no other person knows about this account or any other beneficiary. My investigations prove to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and has no attachment to the said amount. The amount involved is 56 MILLION USD (FIFTY-SIX MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) ONLY. In the light of the fact, I needed your assistance to open your door to this opportunity by providing your account or any account of your choice where the fund will be remitted. I want to transfer this money into a safe foreignerÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s account abroad but I donÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t know any one who could actually assist, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can only be approved to a foreign account because the money is in US Dollars and the owner of the account ENGR. SMITH U. WILLIAMS and a foreigner too. I know that this mail will come as surprise to you as we donÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t know ourselves, but be sure that is for real. I got your contact on the believing that you will not let me down in this business. You are the only person that I have contacted for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will let you know what steps to take next. Send also your private telephone, fax and mobile number for easy communication including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with foreign account. I need your full co-operation to make this work out alright. Your assistance as foreigner is necessary because the management is ready to welcome any person, a foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you immediately, if you are interested to conclude this transaction with me. If your are capable of handling such amount in strict confidence, keeping to my instructions I need a sincere person for this venture because I donÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t want to make mistake, I need your strong assurance that this money will be intact pending my arrival in your country for sharing. You should be informed strictly that I will burn all the documents in your presence immediately after this money has been remitted to your account leaving no trace to any place. I will apply for annual leave immediately I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. This is to enable me use my position and influence to effect legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange department. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 20% of the total amount, 70% will be for us and 10%for any expenses incurred during the transaction. I look forward to your earnest reply.Yours truly, MR. MARTINS AKU",1

"pverveeSecretary Clinton ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂI understand you are going to Kenya next week and while I know the trip is primarily focused on trade issues Iwanted to flag an issue for you because I know it is near and dear to your heart.Kenya has one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in Africa ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ it is illegal unless a woman's life is at risk andcriminalizes both the woman and the provider. Two years ago Kenyan authorities imprisoned a doctor andtwo nurses falsely accusing them of providing illegal abortions. After a year in prison the providers werefound innocent and released but it galvanized the legal and provider community who formed a coalition tomake abortion less restrictive. It will come as no surprise to you that as a result of their abortion law Kenyahas one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of Africa with an estimated 800 women a day seekingthe procedure often through dangerous means.Kenya is restarting a long-stalled constitutional review process and they hope to produce a final Constitutionby next year. Religious groups are on a concerted crusade to include new language in the Constitution whichwould codify that ""life begins at conception"". The current Constitution is largely silent on the issue. If this fetalpersonhood amendment goes forward it would place Kenya in the small community of nations with such aprovision. It would clearly mark Kenya as out of stop with countries attempting to institutionalize the AfricanUnion's Maputo Protocol one of the most progressive regional documents on women development andreproductive rights and with the vast majority of African countries in general. For a country trying to regainthe momentum of stability and success it enjoyed until recently such a policy imposition would be aregression for women's rights and for the country writ large.I went to Kenya last month to work with the coalition that has formed to strategize against the Constitutionalamendment and to work toward a less restrictive abortion law. I also visited several of our clinics andproviders in Nairobi and in nearby villages where Planned Parenthood has programs to train providers in postabortion care. You have seen this a million times in your travels around the world so I don't need to tell youhow poignant the stories were of the lives saved and lost the bravery in standing up to constant governmentharassment and the fear of what this potential Constitutional amendment will mean to the provision of safemedical services. I know it is asking a lot but if there is any way that you could draw attention to this issuewhen you are in Kenya you would be even more of my personal hero than you already are. It is our hope thatif Kenya knows the world is watching they may be more careful in how they proceed. Of course we would behappy to help you in any way if you decide you want to do something on this while you are there. There is alsoa Congressional delegation going to Kenya the week of August 8th and we are working on them to have a sidemeeting on this issue as well.As always thank you so much for all you do. We are all so grateful that you are there! All best LaurieLaurie RubinerVice President of Public Policy and AdvocacyPlanned Parenthood Federation of America(202) 973-4863 office",1

We are saddled with the task of auditing theAccounts of government parastatals and ministries forthe last ten years.In the course of our work at the committee, we discoveredthis fund which resulted from gross re-valuation ofcontracts by top government officials of the lastAdministration. The companies that executed theContracts have been duly paid and the contractsCommissioned leaving the sum of US$15.6 Millionfloating in the escrow account of the Central Bank ofNigeria ready for payment.I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust bymy colleagues in the committee to look for an overseaspartner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$15.6MLegally subcontracting the entitlement to you/yourcompany. This is bearing in mind that our civilservice code of conduct forbids us from owningforeign company or running foreign account while ingovernment service hence the need for an overseaspartner.We have agreed that the funds will be shared after ithas been paid into your nominated account based oneach parties negotiation upon your acceptance andwillingness to assist us in this transaction.

"FROM:- MRS HELLEN P. ANYANWU.JOHANNESBURG SOUTH AFRICA.Dear Sir/Madam,I am writing to you out of a painful heart and situation, which our president has caused us the farmers. I know   you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. I am HELLEN P. ANYANWU the wife of MR. EVANS PETERSON  ANYANWU, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through network online hence decided to write to you. Before the death of my husband, he was the onwer of (ANYANWU INDUSTRIES PTY LTD) in Zimbabwe a Company which specialize in Agriculture and the Supply of Agricultural Equipments. Before his murder  had taken me to South Africa to deposit the sum of USD$15. Million (Fifteen MILLION   United States Dollars) in one of the private Security Companies, as if he foresaw  the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as to avoid more demurrage from the Security Company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of a new farm in Swaziland a small country  near Zimbabwe here. This land problem came when Zimbabwe President MR. ROBERT MUGABE introduced a New Land Act reform, which Wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few Black farmers. This resulted to killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my husband was one of the victims.It is against this background that my family and I who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my husband money to a foreign Country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zones of South Africa.As his wife, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking for a genuine foreign Account where this money could be transferred into without the knowledge of my government who are bent on my family, or I can arrange with the security company to send the money as a consignment to their sister company in your country for you to go there and sign it out.I must also let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family then the lawyer or consultant will help me and you in opening a non resident account in your name   which will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas or you provide your address were the security company can ship it as a consignment to you. This money I intend to use for investment and growth in your country. I have two options; firstly you can choose to have certain Percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of this money in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses we might incur in the   process of this transaction.If you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 25% of the total money while remaining 70% will remain for my family and me. If you are really capable and willing to assist me, please contact me immediately with the above telephone number with which I have sent you this message.Finally, please treat this matter as urgent as possible. I am in dire need to leave this country with my family soonest.Thanks for your mutual co-operation.I expect your soonest response.Best regards,MRS. HELLEN ANYANWU. Please send your response to (hellenpeterson@gmail.com)(For the family).",1

Reason: 1.4(B) 1.4(D) ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Declassify on: 04/23/2035RELEASE IN PARTB11.4(B)1.4(D)B6,0
FYI: From one of the folks we hired who had been working with Pierre Louis:Lessons from the Aceh and Nias Multi-Donor Trust Fund1. The Government of Indonesia (G01) responded to the Tsunami by issuing a series of government decreesand immediately organized both overview and relief efforts to ensure a rational and coordinatedresponse. The first task was to produce a Damage and Loss Assessment (DLA). The DLA was followed bya more detailed Master Plan for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (MPRR). The MPRR provided in-depthsector plans spatial planning the governance and supervision arrangements of finances withconsiderable attention to how to avoid or minimize corruption. The process behind the MPRR wasconsultative with a wide range of local stakeholders and public offices being heard. The MPRR waspresented on 26 March only 3 months after the Tsunami.2. The MPRR was to form the basis for a general three-stage strategy. The Relief phase was originally set tosix months but was then reduced to three: January- March 2005. The Rehabilitation phase is to run forabout 21 months through December 2006 and the Reconstruction phase from July 2006 throughDecember 2009. The MPRR provides a well defined phasing of interventions.3. The objectives for the Relief efforts were humanitarian relief: rescue; food and medicine; emergencyinfrastructure and temporary shelter; and burying the dead. The Rehabilitation phase is to restoreservices to minimum level: public services; economic facilities; banking and financial institutions; traumatreatments; secure land rights; law and order; and temporary shelter. Finally Reconstruction is to rebuildthe region: rebuilding the economy (production trade and banking); the transportationtelecommunications and social and cultural systems; improving institutional capacity; and housing.4. The Government set up a ministerial-level agency to manage the MPRR program from Aceh itself theRehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency for Aceh and Nias. The BRR was formally established end April2005 and became operational early May. The World Bank Board on 30 March 2005 formally establishedthe Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDF) with a Steering Committee comprised of BRR GOI donors and civilsociety. Having a credible local coordinators was key to success.5. The EC channels nearly 93% of its funds through the MDF while only 2.5% of USD 400 million from theUS goes to the MDF. While payments into the fund were slow disbursements out of it were to beginwith even slower. By October 2005 project agreements for about USD 200 million had been signed butonly USD 3 million had actually been disbursed. Disbursements picked up the pace thereafter. The delaywas caused by two principal impediments: first donors were quick to pledge funds but getting all theexact written agreements in place took time. This points to the need for donors to be flexible regardingformal agreements and accept simple generic paragraphs that can contribute to speedy resolution ofslightly differing phrasings and concerns. Second the processing time for project approval andimplementation was a concern. Since the MDF was to have funded projects on-budget they had to beimplemented by government institutions. This crated bottlenecks.6. Smaller donors joined because they wished to support the reconstruction efforts in Aceh but do not haveown capacity and often not strong views on how best to pursue this. They want the Bank to assumefiduciary responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk environment and also to take a lead in ensuring thatthe funds go to prioritized activities. The MDF is thus seen a well-managed bank account with some paid-for administrative services. However the all-inclusive Steering Committee made membership large andto some extent unwieldy and forced it to discuss both policy and operational issues.7. The Multi Donor Fund Secretariat has developed an Outreach Strategy that includes regular radio talkshows field visits to meet and discuss with beneficiaries and communication through advertisements aswell as a telephone hotline.8. MDF received praise for engaging the Government of Indonesia (G01) in policy dialogue. The MDF is thusan entry point for engaging on conditions for sustainability relevance and impact.9. Because the MDF does not accept strict ear marking of donor contributions ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ though it does allow forpreference indications ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ it means that the funds are freely available for programming according to thecriteria and priorities that the MDF agrees to. Given strong GOI participation the MDF is seen as themost successful instrument for harmonization and coordination in an environment that has beencriticized for a lack of coordination. The MDF's Mid Term Review conducted in 2008-2009 found that theMDF had made a positive contribution to harmonizing donor efforts and to increasing the effectivenessand efficiency of the reconstruction effort.10. The MDF did not sufficiently engage the private sector and did not have a coherent job creation strategy.The MDF lacked executive rights but GOI and BRR are credited with leveraging a decisive response.,1

"Slaughter Anne-Marie <SlaughterAÃÂÃÂ©state.gov>Thursday May 6 2010 7:18 PMSullivan JacobJThe political ramifications of the Greek/European debt crisisAs you know the EU-IMF-USG consensus hope motivating the Greek bailout is that it will buy time for Spain Portugaletc. From widening credit spreads to falling stock prices most relevant market indicators are responding with doubt.Former IMF Chief Economist and NYT Columnist (and influential blogger for bond traders) Simon Johnson has animportant rejoinder to this consensus hope in today's NYT full text pasted below.As the EU has no playbook for most of the pressing questions it faces my staff is working tobrainstorm as to the least bad of what are only sobering options.This is long but worth it.May 6 2010 6:11 amIt's Not About Greece AnymoreBy PETER BOONE AND SIMON JOHNSONLouisa Gouliamaki/AgenceFrance-Presse ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Getty Images Protesters waved flags from the Acropolis archaeological site behind banners in Englishand Greek hung in front of the Parthenon temple in Athens.Peter Boone is chairman of the charity Effective Interventionand a research associate at the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. He is also aprincipal in Salute Capital Management Ltd. Simon Johnson the former chief economist at the International MonetaryFund is the co-author of ""13 Bankers.""The Greek ""rescue"" package announced last weekend is dramatic unprecedentedand far from enough to stabilize the euro zone.The Greek government and the European Union leadership prodded bythe International Monetary Fund are finally becoming realistic about the dire economic situation in Greece. They haveabandoned previous rounds of optimistic forecasts and have now admitted to a profoundly worse situation. This newprogram calls for ""fiscal adjustments"" ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ cuts to the fiscal deficit mostly through spending cuts ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ totaling 11 percent ofgross domestic product in 2010 4.3 percent in 2011 and 2 percent in 2012 and 2013. The total debt-to-G.D.P. ratiopeaks at 149 percent in 2012-13 before starting a gentle glide path back down to sanity.This new program is honestenough to show why it is unlikely to succeed.Daniel Gros an eminent economist on euro zone issues based in Brusselshas argued that for each 1 percent of G.D.P. decline in Greek government spending total demand in the country falls by2.5 percent of G.D.P. If the government reduces spending by 15 percent of G.D.P. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the initial shock to demand couldbe well over 30 percent of G.D.P.Obviously this simple rule does not work with such large numbers but it illustrates thatGreece is likely to experience a very sharp recession ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ and there is substantial uncertainty around how bad theeconomy will get. The program announced last weekend assumes Greek G.D.P. falls by 4 percent this year then byanother 2.6 percent in 2011 before recovering to positive growth in 2012 and beyond.Such figures seem extremelyoptimistic particularly in the face of the civil unrest now sweeping Greece and the deep hostility expressed towardGreece in some northern European policy circles.The pattern of growth is critical because under this program Greeceneeds to grow out of its debt problem soon. Greece's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio will be a debilitating 145 percent at the endof 2011.Now consider putting more realistic growth figures into the I.M.F. forecast for Greece's economy ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ e.g. withG.D.P. declining 12 percent in 2011 then the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio may reach 155 percent. At these levels with a 5percent real interest rate and no growth the country needs a primary surplus at 8 percent of G.D.P. to keep the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio stable. It will be nowhere near that level. The I.M.F. program has Greece running a primary budget deficitof around 1 percent of G.D.P. in that year and that assumes a path for Greek growth that can be regarded only as an""upside scenario.""The politics of these implied budget surpluses remains brutal. Since most Greek debt is held abroadroughly 80 percent of the budget savings the Greek government makes go straight to Germans French and other foreigndebt holders (mostly banks). If growth turns out poorly will the Greeks be prepared for ever-tougher austerity to paythe Germans? Even if everything goes well Greek citizens seem unlikely to welcome this version of their ""new normal.""Last week the European leadership panicked ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ very late in the day ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ when it realized that the euro zone itself was atrisk of a meltdown. If the euro zone proves unwilling to protect a member like Greece from default then bond investorswill run from Portugal and Spain also ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ if you doubt this study carefully the interlocking debt picture publishedrecently in The New York Times. Higher yields on government debt would have caused concerns about potential bankruns in these nations and then spread to more nations in Europe.When there is such a ""run"" it is not clear where itstops. In the hazy distance Belgium France Austria and many others were potentially at risk.Even the Germans cannot afford to bail out those nations.Slapped in the face by this ugly scenario the Europeansdecided to throw everything they and the I.M.F. had at bailing out Greece. The program as announced has only a smallchance of preventing eventual Greek bankruptcy but it may still slow or avert a dangerous spiral downward ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ andenormous collateral damage ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ in the rest of Europe.The I.M.F. floated in some fashion an alternative scenario with adebt restructuring but this was rejected by both the European Union and the Greek authorities. This is not a surprise;leading European policy makers are completely unprepared for broader problems that would follow a Greek""restructuring"" because markets would immediately mark down the debt (i.e. increase the yields) for Portugal SpainIreland and even Italy.The fear and panic in the face of this would be unparalleled in modern times: When the Greekspay only 50 percent on the face value of their debt what should investors expect from the Portuguese and Spanish? Itall becomes arbitrary including which countries are dragged down.Someone has to decide who should be defended andat what cost and the European structures are completely unsuited to this kind of tough decision-making underpressurein the extreme downside scenario Germany is the only obvious safe haven within the euro zone so itsgovernment bond yields would collapse while other governments face sharply rising yields. The euro zone would likelynot hold together.There is still a narrow escape path without immediate debt default and the chaos that that wouldproduce:-Talk down the euro ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ moving toward parity with the American dollar would help lift growth across the euroz one.-As the euro falls bond yields will rise on the euro zone periphery. This will create episodes of panic. Enough short-termfinancing must be in place to support the rollover of government debt..Once the euro has fallen a great deal announce the European Central Bank will support the euro at those levels (i.e.prevent appreciation with G-20 tacit agreement) and also support the peripheral euro zone nations viewed as solventby buying their bonds whenever markets are chaotic.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢At that stage but not before the euro zone leadership needs to push weaker governments to restructure. That willinclude Greece and perhaps also Portugal. Hopefully in this scenario Spain can muddle through.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢European banks should be recapitalized as necessary and have most of their management replaced. This is a massivefailure of euro groupthink ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ including most notably at the political level ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ but there is no question that bank executiveshave not behaved responsibly in a long while and should be replaced en masse.To the extent possible some of theensuing losses should be shared with bank creditors. But be careful what you wish for. The bankers are powerful for areason; they have built vital yet fragile structures at the heart of our economies. Dismantle with care.",0

"hello my dear,my name is aishatu ahmed.my father was recently murdered in tripoli as a result of family and friends conflicts due to a substantial amount he made while he was in the ministry.generally,most rich men keep such fund at their homes as it is illegal for one to keep such amount in any bank in lybia without a proper explaination as per how such fund was made .so these wicked people thought that this fund was still in our mansion and they tried to eliminate all our house hold in order to get free access to our home to search for it  unknowing to them that my late father had already moved the fund to a finance house in europe through diplomatic means leaving me as the beneficiary as if he forsaw the danger in our family.just one week after his burial,these people broke into our home with gun shots everywhere which resulted to the death of my only little brother.that very night,i and my mother escaped and ran to a country(by road) called burkina faso where we ar! e for the moment in a hidden hotel.i got your contact from a consultancy firm here in burkina faso,though i did not let them know my main reason of contacting you for confidential sake as i only told them that i needed your contact for pen pals.i need your faithfully and confidential asistance to get this fund from the finance house in europe as we are financially down due to our unprepared journey to this place,ofwhich we left all our belongings and other valuables for our dear lives hoping to get this money out of the finance house.luckily for us,we came here with all the documents relating to this fund.if you have any question to ask,please feel free to do so and get back to me soonest.aishatu",1
">From . Mr. Simon Robson.Kindest Attention:My name is Mr. Simon Robson. I am from Portugal. I have been diagnosedwith esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, andright now I have only about a few months to live, according to medicalexperts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I neverreally cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I amvery rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and onlyfocused  on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now Iregretall this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting tohave or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me asecond chance to come to this world I would live my life a different wayfrom  how I have lived it.Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my propertyand assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as fewclose friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so,Ihave decided to give alms to charity organizations and those in Need,as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, Ihave distributed money to some charity organizations when I was well. Nowthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts anddistribute the money which I have there to charity organization in UnitedStates, Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and kept the money tothemselves.Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended withwhat I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of isthe huge cash deposit of Twenty Million United States Dollars ($20,000,000.00) that I have with an Asset Management / Vaulting CompanyAbroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it tocharity organizations and use it to help those in Need.",1

"Direct and private cell number +447040114795Direct and private Telephone + 447040121012Direct and private fax number +447005804255Dear Friend,I am Mr. T. Smith, deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safekeeping.No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes.The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like houses, hotels and doing charity works etc)Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we can have a smooth communication.Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email ( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com )Thanks and regards.TONY SMITHN.BReply me only on this my alternative emailttss7520062006@mixmail.com ",1

When can we do conf call on speech?,0
I will be at a USGLC breakfast doing qddr so won't be at morning meeting. You will see speech which is very hard towrite given magnitude of report coupled w/ own hall setting. We have aimed it really at press to try to focus them asprecisely as possible in what we want their stories to be so it's important to get those key message out. But I would justurge you also to speak from the heart -- you know what this is reallly about better than anyone and if your passion formaking this happen and commitment to getting it done come through it will frame the entire exercise. This is your onlychance to speak to the press about 14 months of work until we relaunch in January. There is too much going on to makeheadlines but we want there to be positive press saying you are ahead of the curve (and the new Congress) in makinggovt work better. AM,0

"Good Day,With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation. My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!nd) to seek for political asylum.I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam. President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here.I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.Your role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.To know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola, click on the links below and read. http://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.htmlhttp:/ews.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africaewsid_1839000/1839252.stmSincerely,O.C.Savimbi.",1

"FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE WAR ENDED, THE RADIO NATIONAL OF LIBERIA WENT ON AIR, ON A WILD BROADCAST, UNCINGAN UNSUCCESSFUL ""COUPD'TAT"" IN MY COUNTRY, ATTEPTED TO OVERTROW THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT IN MY COUNTRY HEADED BY ""PRESIDENT CHARLES TAYLOR"". THIS BROADCAST CONTINUED TO ANNOUNCE THE NAMES OF THOSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ATTEMPT. BUT UNKNOWINGLY TO ME, MY FATHER WAS INCLUDED AMOUNG THESE GROUP OF MEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PLOT AS THE ""MASTERMINDER"" AND THE ""FINANCIER"" OF THIS UNDEMOCRATIC ACT. ALTHOUGH HE WAS EXECUTED ALONG SIDE WITH OTHERS. (MAY THEIR SOULS REST IN PERFECT PEACE)TWO WEEKS AFTER THEIR EXECUTION THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBERIA STIL WENT FURTHER TO PASS JURGEMENT TO CONFISTICATE MY FATHER'S ASSETS AND ALSO TO FREEZE HIS ACCOUNTS. SO WHEN THIS NEWS REACHED ME, I HURRIEDLY GATHERED SOME VALUABLES IN OUR FAMILY VILLA   AND ESCAPED TO (ACCRA), CAPITAL OF GHANA FOR SAFETY, WHILE MY MOTHER AND MY BROTHERS, SISTERS ARE NOW IN COTE D'IVOIRE AS REFUGEES.

WITH THIS, COUPLED WITH THE WAY IN WHICH THE MONEY WAS ACQUIRED, AND I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW ABOUT THIS DEVELOPMENT THAT IS WHY I DECIDED NOT TO INVEST IN ANYWHERE IN AFRICA OR LIBERIA NOR EVEN GHANA WHERE I AM CURRENTLY RESIDING AS A REFUGEE AND THAT IS WHY I'M SOLICITING FOR YOUR SUPPORT.IF YOU AGREE TO ASSIST US, I WILL COMPENSATE YOU WITH 15% OF THE TOTAL FUND AFTER THIS CONSIGNMENT IS CLEARED AND THE MONEY TRANSFERED INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.",1
Whenever you do something big on TV we all hear from lots of folks saying you did great. But this time is noticeablydifferent. First people across the spectrum - DC insiders reporters staff ex-staff friends of friends WH folks etc -were blown away. Second people were REALLY moved by the last segment three people even told me they teared up.I'm guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days.And I think because it's been a lousy couple of weeks for the Admin with mixed messages and bad news coupled withmany people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with thePresident and that combo was probably the most powerful reminder since your speech in Denver that you're in a classall your own (including the President who became enmeshed in the Gates incident)That you didn't wait for the envoy question was key you turned it into a strength. What you said about the Presidentand how you said it one can't help but think how much of a team player you are and how remarkably you've adapted tothe role.You were definitely on your game. You either threw a perfect game - or at least a no hitter. So this couldn't have gonebetter achieved everything we needed to times 10 and comes on the heels of a great 10 days.Will be interesting to see the storyline that emanates from this. Because there was no substantive news it'll be a focuson style especially saving Biden.,0

"H:Les Gelb who oversaw the writing of the Pentagon Papers makes the points that Wikileaks show US today trying tosolve difficult international problems telling the truth and diplomats acting professionally.Wiki Leaks Accidentally Helps U.S.by Leslie H. GelbNovember 30 2010 I 10:42pmJulian Assange clearly intended the State Dept. cable leaks to smear the U.S. as evil and selfish. LeslieH. Gelb on how he inadvertently proved the opposite.The Wikileakers dumped a vast pile of secrets to prove that the United States was selfish stupid and wickedÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂbut theirrevelations proved just the opposite. When you remove the gossip and obvious trivia that mesmerized the press youclearly see what the Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously and professionally trying to solve the mostdangerous problems in a frighteningly complicated world yet lacking the power to dictate solutions. U.S. policymakersand diplomats are shown quite accurately doing what they are supposed to do: ferreting out critical information fromforeign leaders searching for paths to common action and struggling with the right amount of pressure to apply on alliesand adversaries. And in most cases the villain is not Washington but foreign leaders escaping common action withcowardice and hypocrisy.Don't think for a New York minute that Julian Assange the Wikileaker unloaded this trove to save humankind. Why did hetoss in those cables about Italy's leader being a rake and Germany's chancellor being a cautious fuddy-duddy andPresident Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan being ""paranoid""? To save the world? Not a chance. He did it to get attention andhe got attention from a drooling press which then went on to call the very material they were highlighting trivial. DidAssange leak critical conversations with Chinese or Arab leaders to help solve the problems in Korea and Iran? Not by thehair on your chinny chin chin. He did it to show that he could do itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂand for the attention. Anyone who is not a hopelessleft-wing ideologue knows that such leaks will crush future serious conversations with those leaders for some time tocome. Just think: if you told someone a serious and critical confidence about someone else and your confidant went outand told others would you soon repeat that mistake? Assange did not leak these cables to help solve world problems.These leaks were absolutely gratuitous and served only the purpose of making him a media marvel.When you actually read the cables here's what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucialworld In explaining his deed publicly Assange suggests that what he's doing is uncovering American misdeeds and lies.His aim he says is to inform citizens of democracies and peoples around the world about what their leaders are reallydoing. Assange also insists he did this for transparency's sake. Yet when he got to look inside he didn't see what wasplain: that our diplomats were doing a good job. Indeed when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strangecommentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers when you actually read the cables here'swhat you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.But when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange commentary on cable news and even on the frontpages of great newspapers when you actually read the cables here's what you see: American leaders and Americandiplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂWashington needs China's help in bolstering sanctions against Iran and China balks for fear of jeopardizing its oil andgas flow from that country. The Obama team arranges for Saudi Arabia to guarantee any loss in supply to China. If theworld wants to slow or even prevent Iran's march to nuclear weaponry this is a key path to doing so.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂThe U.S. discovers that North Korea has manufactured new medium-range missiles and is trying to deliver them to Iranthrough China. The Obama team discovers this informs Beijing and asks Beijing to stop the transfer. Beijing declines.Really creepy.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂYemen's leader takes public responsibility for American missile attacks against Al Qaeda in Yemen. He wants todiminish the power of these terrorists as do Americans and most others in the world. The ""lie"" by the Yemeni president isa harmless way to get a critical job doneÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂthat is the job of fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away thepolitical cover of Yemen's leaders.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂNo country has anywhere near as much influence over nutty North Korea as China. So U.S. diplomats are searchingdesperately to figure out Chinese thinking about North Korea in order to compose a plan for avoiding war on the KoreanPeninsula. So the Wikileakers expose some Chinese leaders who are actually trying to give us some insight into Chinesethinking about North Korean craziness. They won't do that again soon.Time and again as one actually reads these cables one has to be heartened by the professionalism and the insights ofU.S. diplomats. What are they doing? They are not lying and U.S. leaders are not lying. They are actually believe it ornot trying to solve problems. That seriousness of purpose and the professionalism to execute it is what jumps out at youin these materials.So the naÃÂÃÂ¯ve say it's good to show the effectiveness of our diplomats. Give me a break. Ask any American diplomat tochoose between looking intelligent in leaked cables and making progress toward avoiding war.None of this is to say that there should not be leaks or that the press should not pursue classified information that isnecessary or very helpful to a sensible public debate on policy. If a U.S. administration is lying or distorting the facts ortelling one story to the public and another to itself then by all means let's have it out in public. If the U.S. government isconcocting intelligence in order to justify wars let's hope an enterprising reporter finds it out for the rest of us.But the Wikileaks dump is not about providing essential information to Americans or to othersÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂinformation they need forserious policy discussion. This massive trashing by Wikileaks of a legitimate effort by the U.S. government to preserveconfidentiality is the very least a shame and at the most a crime.Leslie H. Gelb a former New York Times columnist and senior government official is author of Power Rules: HowCommon Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy (HarperCollins 2009) a book that shows how to think about anduse power in the 21st century.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration targeted key leaders of Afghanistan's Taliban with new financialsanctions Thursday in a move that could complicate relations with Pakistan and Afghan efforts to reconcile withinsurgents.The action by the Treasury Department will freeze the militants' assets ban travel and trigger an arms embargo. Itfollows similar action by the United Nations earlier this week and comes after calls from Gen. David Petraeus the topmilitary commander in Afghanistan and Sen. Carl Levin D-Mich. chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee forsanctions against Afghan insurgent commanders operating in Pakistan.Taken together the U.S. and U.N. sanctions prohibit any financial transactions of the terror leaders in U.N. membercountries putting additional pressure on Pakistan to take broader actions against the Taliban militants.Three financial kingpins were targeted with sanctions including a key member of the Haqqani network whichdirectsoperations against U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan from safe havens in Pakistan. Among those sanctionedThursday was Nasiruddin Haqqani an emissary for the Haqqani Network and brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani who leadsthe group with his father Jalaluddin.Others sanctioned included Gul Agha Ishakzai the head of the Taliban's financial commission and Amir Abdullah theformer treasurer to captured Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Barader. The sanctions placed on the three leaders asterrorists would deprive them of the assets they need to fund their terror operations said Adam J. Szubin director ofTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. ""We will continue to aggressively work to expose and dismantle the financialnetworks of terrorist groups in support of the president's goal of a stable Afghanistan"" he said.According to officials lshakzai is the head of the Taliban's financial commission has collected money for suicide attacksin Kandahar Afghanistan and has been involved in the disbursement of funds for Taliban fighters. He has served as amain financial officer and close adviser to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar. Abdullah has reportedly traveled toKuwait Saudi Arabia Libya and the United Arab Emirates to raise money for the Taliban and facilitate meetings andcommunications with key leaders. Nasiruddin Haqqani has collected funds for the Haqqani group including from al-Qaida. Last week Gen. David Petraeus the top military commander in Afghanistan urged officials to add commandersfrom the Haqqani network to the terrorist list. At the time administration officials said a review was under way largelyaccelerated after the May 1 failed Times Square bombing. The man who has pleaded guilty in the New York incidentPakistani-born American Faisal Shahzad said he trained with the Pakistani Taliban to build bombs then returned to theU.S. to launch an attack that would avenge attacks on Muslims by U.S. forces overseas.",0

The plan is to have a large screen off to your side so that it won't get in the way of a tight shot. We've worked withNational Geographic on the photos -- some of which are quite stunning -- and they'll pace the presentation slowly withlong transitions so it's not distracting.
